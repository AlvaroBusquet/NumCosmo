 * Functions to compute the 3-dimensional integral over the true, SZ and lensing
     masses are working. There are two set of functions to compute it
     (independently). The main diference between them is the set of integral
     variables: 1) logarithm base e of the masses and  2) new variables (we
     performed a change of variables). The later provides the best results and
     it is in agreement with the 1+2 integral (integration over true mass and a
     bidimensional integration over SZ and lensing masses) for any values of the
     parameters.

     manually convert NcmVector and NcmMatrix to variant when using it as object
     property.

     Updated all objects (but NcDataClusterPseudoCounts) to use
     NcmVector/NcmMatrix directly as properties instead of their GVariant
     versions.

 * Documentation improvements (in progress): some NcClusterMass' children,
     ncm_abc.c and ncm_lh_ratio1d.c.

     Implemented bidimensional integrations [divonne function (libcuba)] using
     and not using peakfinder. Idem for tridimensional integration with no
     peakfinder.

     Implemented functions to compute the integrand peaks in
     nc_cluster_mass_plcl and nc_cluster_pseudo_counts: testing! Created

     implemented using cuhre function (libcuba). Documentation: improvement in
     different files.

 * Removed old INCLUES in Makefile.am. Threaded evaluation for real data in
     cluster abundance. Reorganized ncm_func_eval_threaded_loop to simply run
     the loop function when threads are disabled. Added CUBACORES=0 to
     environment in to avoid parallelization in libcuba.

 * Documentation fixes.

 * Memory leak fixed in nc_cluster_mass_benson.c and
     nc_cluster_mass_vanderlinde.c. Debug messages were removed.

 * Moved gobj_itest from bin_PROGRAMS to noinst_PROGRAMS. Added transfer full to
     the return value of ncm_reparam_ref.

 * Bug fixed: when it was set a reparametrization, all other parameters were reset
     to their default values. Now only those parameters modified by the
     reparametrization are set to the new parameter default values.

     Internal function _ncm_model_reset_sparam -> _ncm_model_set_sparam. Created
     function _ncm_model_sparams_remove_reparam.

 * Tinker multiplicity function - critical: for Delta > 3200, it is set Delta =
     3200 and a warning message is provided.

 * Testing resample and montecarlo tools.

 * Fixed bug in ncm_fit_montecarlo_matrix

     ncm_mset_prepare_fparam_map is now correctly called when resampling.

 * Developing new mass-observable relation.

 * Fixed bugs in reparams. Now --flat works again.

 * Testing cr algorithms.

 * Extended limits in Omega variables.

 * Added test to check if libnlopt exists. Testing nc_galaxy_acf.

     There is a bug in nlopt package, when built with c++ support it builds only
     the libnlopt_cxx library which cannot be linked to a pure C library. Also,
     in the nlopt.pc it informs that the library is linked using -lnlopt, even
     though the correct would be -lnlopt_cxx. Thus, we added a extra check to
     see if -lnlopt is available.

 * New implementations of NcClusterMass.

     Removed old structure NcClusterAbundanceOpt. NcClusterMassVanderlinde:
     Implemented SZ signal-mass relation as described in Vanderlinde et al., The
     Astrophysical Journal, 722:1180-1196, 2010. NcClusterMassBenson:
     Implemented SZ signal-mass relation as described in Benson et al.,
     arxiv:1112.5435. NcClusterBensonXRay: Implemented SZ signal-mass and X-ray
     relations as described in Benson et al., arxiv:1112.5435. WORK IN PROGRESS!

 * Renamed special functions to comply with the library standards.

 * Reorganized NcMassFunction. Adjusted to correct functions names and _prepare
     function usage.

     Optimized NcMassFunction and NcClusterAbundance functions. Optimized
     NcmSpline2dCubic eval function. Optimized NcMassFunction putting some
     functions as inline functions.

     Fixed bug in ncm_numdiff_2_err that wont put the correct value of ferr. 
     Fixed bug in function_eval that readed an already freed memory. Fixed bug
     in ncm_fit_numdiff_m2lnL_hessian, wrong comparions between absolute and
     relative errors.

     Fixed leak in ncm_cfg_create_from_name_params, changed g_variant_dup_string
     => g_variant_get_string. Fixed leak in darkenergy.c, added g_strfreev ()
     after g_strsplit (). Fixed leak in ncm_mset.c, added free for fpi_array in
     finalize. Fixed leak several (almost all) detected using valgrind's
     memecheck.

     Reworked several objects to comply with ref/unref paradigm.

 * Fixed indentation.

 * Included g_assert in Tinker multiplicity functions (mean and critical) to
     assert that Delta <= 3200.

 * Renamed flag plane => flat.

 * Finished NcClusterMassLnnormal.

     Renamed internal variables in nc_cluster_mass_nodist.c.

 * Finished paralelization to compute m2ln of cluster abundance. Still in test.

     Registered NcClusterMassLnnormal in ncm_cfg.c.

 * Fixed bug in function_eval lf => lfunc.

 * Updated configure.ac using autoupdate.

     Added test to check if sundials uses long int instead of int and a macro to
     use the appropriated type. This is necessary since in version 2.5.0
     sundials' api have changed.

 * New organization of NcClusterAbundance and NcDataClusterAbundance.

     Removed old nc_data_cluster_abundance_binned_init_from_text_file_gkey. 
     Removed old nc_data_cluster_abundance_binned_init_from_text_file. Removed
     old nc_cluster_matching_catalog_save. Removed old
     nc_cluster_matching_catalog_load.

     Adapted darkenergy to use new NcClusterAbundance and NcDataClusterAbundance 
     framework.

     Testing function_eval on NcDataClusterAbundance.

     Reworked function_eval to split loops.

     Renamed NC_THREAD_POOL_MAX to NCM_THREAD_POOL_MAX.

 * Missing files.

 * Bug fixing and new implementations.

     Moved NcClusterPhotoz to NcClusterRedshift. Moved NcClusterPhotozInd to
     NcClusterPhotoz.

     Removed old functions from NcClusterAbundance.

     Bug - NCM_GMODEL macro was used instead of NCM_MODEL - fixed. Bug -
     NcClusterRedshift should be abstract class - fixed. Bug - NcHaloBiasType
     should be abstract class - fixed. Bug - NcMultiplicityFunc should be
     abstract class - fixed. Bug - NcTransferFunc should be abstract class -
     fixed. Bug - NcWindow should be abstract class - fixed. Bug - Unintialized
     splines in NcMatterVar - fixed. Bug - DataClusterPrepare passing wrong
     pointer to NcClusterAbundance - fixed. Bug - In Spline2d functions
     int_d(x|y)_spline there were one extra iteration in the loops - fixed.

     Added pz_min and pz_max properties to NcClusterPhotozGlobal and
     NcClusterPhotoz Added new abstract class NcClusterMass. Added new abstract
     class NcClusterMass implementation NcClusterMassNodist. Added new abstract
     class NcClusterRedshift implementation NcClusterRedshiftNodist. Added more
     objects to the register config in ncm_cfg_init.

     Optimized NcClusterAbundance inverse calc, still room for improvement.

     Still working in NcClusterAbundance NcClusterMass* NcClusterRedshift* api
     not fixed yet

 * Added a simple GObject (de)serialization function set. Added nc_hicosmo_free
     function. Added tests for GObject (de)serialization. This msg is for the
     last commit.

 * Updated manual URL

 * Updated manual URL

 * Fixed documentation build.


[v0.8.0]
 * New repository for savannah upload. Corrected AUTHORS and README, added
     COPYING. Erased old TODO. Version bumped to 0.8.0.
