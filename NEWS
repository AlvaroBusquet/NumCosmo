NcClusterMass

	* NcClusterMass object was adapted to NcmModel.
	* Now the parameters of the mass-observable (M-O) 
	  relation can be fitted. Therefore it is able to 
	  simultaneously fit both M-O and cosmological 
	  parameters (self-calibration).

	* The integrals of NcClusterMassVanderlinde and 
	  NcClusterMassBenson were optimized.

Tinker Multiplicity Function: improvement

	* Tinker et al. multiplicity function, when dark 
	  matter halo mass is defined in terms of the 
	  critical density, is computed using a spline 
	  defined in the interval 200 <= Delta(z) <= 3200.

	* Improvement: This function was extended to 
	  Delta(z) > 3200. In this case the multiplicity 
	  function is computed using the fitting function 
	  given by Eqs.(B1 -- B4) in 
	  http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2706. This extension 
	  was done properly to ensure the continuity of 
	  the multiplicity function.
