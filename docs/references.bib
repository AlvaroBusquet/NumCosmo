  abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has validated and made publicly
	available its Second Data Release. This data release consists of
	3324 deg2 of five-band (ugriz) imaging data with photometry for over
	88 million unique objects, 367,360 spectra of galaxies, quasars,
	stars, and calibrating blank sky patches selected over 2627 deg2
	of this area, and tables of measured parameters from these data.
	The imaging data reach a depth of r~22.2 (95% completeness limit
	for point sources) and are photometrically and astrometrically calibrated
	to 2% rms and 100 mas rms per coordinate, respectively. The imaging
	data have all been processed through a new version of the SDSS imaging
	pipeline, in which the most important improvement since the last
	data release is fixing an error in the model fits to each object.
	The result is that model magnitudes are now a good proxy for point-spread
	function magnitudes for point sources, and Petrosian magnitudes for
	extended sources. The spectroscopy extends from 3800 to 9200 Å at
	a resolution of 2000. The spectroscopic software now repairs a systematic
	error in the radial velocities of certain types of stars and has
	substantially improved spectrophotometry. All data included in the
	SDSS Early Data Release and First Data Release are reprocessed with
	the improved pipelines and included in the Second Data Release. Further
	characteristics of the data are described, as are the data products
	themselves and the tools for accessing them.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital
	Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of
	the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663
	deg2 of imaging data, with most of the \~2000 deg2 increment over
	the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude.
	The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct
	objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120° long,
	2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic
	Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging
	runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly
	2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has
	completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete
	over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing
	the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over
	1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000
	quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar
	photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been
	recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog,
	reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds
	per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright
	galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is
	less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies.
	Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic
	reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength
	calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely
	strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar
	metallicities.},

	to be mounted on the Blanco 4-m telescope at Cerro Telolo Inter-American
	Observatory (CTIO). The survey data will allow us to measure the
	dark energy and dark matter densities and the dark energy equation
	of state through four independent methods: galaxy clusters, weak
	gravitational lensing tomography, galaxy angular clustering, and
	supernova distances. These methods are doubly complementary: they
	constrain different combinations of cosmological model parameters
	and are subject to different systematic errors. By deriving the four
	sets of measurements from the same data set with a common analysis
	framework, we will obtain important cross checks of the systematic
	errors and thereby make a substantial and robust advance in the precision
	of dark energy measurements.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the Sixth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky
	Survey. With this data release, the imaging of the northern Galactic
	cap is now complete. The survey contains images and parameters of
	roughly 287 million objects over 9583 deg2, including scans over
	a large range of Galactic latitudes and longitudes. The survey also
	includes 1.27 million spectra of stars, galaxies, quasars, and blank
	sky (for sky subtraction) selected over 7425 deg2 . This release
	includes much more stellar spectroscopy than was available in previous
	data releases and also includes detailed estimates of stellar temperatures,
	gravities, and metallicities. The results of improved photometric
	calibration are now available, with uncertainties of roughly 1% in
	g, r, i, and z, and 2% in u, substantially better than the uncertainties
	in previous data releases. The spectra in this data release have
	improved wavelength and flux calibration, especially in the extreme
	blue and extreme red, leading to the qualitatively better determination
	of stellar types and radial velocities. The spectrophotometric fluxes
	are now tied to point-spread function magnitudes of stars rather
	than fiber magnitudes. This gives more robust results in the presence
	of seeing variations, but also implies a change in the spectrophotometric
	scale, which is now brighter by roughly 0.35 mag. Systematic errors
	in the velocity dispersions of galaxies have been fixed, and the
	results of two independent codes for determining spectral classifications
	and redshifts are made available. Additional spectral outputs are
	made available, including calibrated spectra from individual 15 minute
	exposures and the sky spectrum subtracted from each exposure. We
	also quantify a recently recognized underestimation of the brightnesses
	of galaxies of large angular extent due to poor sky subtraction;
	the bias can exceed 0.2 mag for galaxies brighter than r=14 mag.},

  abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) started a new phase in 2008 August,
	with new instrumentation and new surveys focused on Galactic structure
	and chemical evolution, measurements of the baryon oscillation feature
	in the clustering of galaxies and the quasar Lyalpha forest, and
	a radial velocity search for planets around ~8000 stars. This paper
	describes the first data release of SDSS-III (and the eighth counting
	from the beginning of the SDSS). The release includes five-band imaging
	of roughly 5200 deg2 in the southern Galactic cap, bringing the total
	footprint of the SDSS imaging to 14,555 deg2, or over a third of
	the Celestial Sphere. All the imaging data have been reprocessed
	with an improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent
	photometric recalibration and flat-field determination. This release
	also includes all data from the second phase of the Sloan Extension
	for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE-2), consisting
	of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 stars at both high and low
	Galactic latitudes. All the more than half a million stellar spectra
	obtained with the SDSS spectrograph have been reprocessed through
	an improved stellar parameter pipeline, which has better determination
	of metallicity for high-metallicity stars.},

  abstract = {We reconstruct the equation of state $w(z)$ of dark energy (DE) using
	a recently released data set containing 172 type Ia supernovae without
	assuming the prior $w(z) \geq -1$ (in contrast to previous studies).
	We find that dark energy evolves rapidly and metamorphoses from dust-like
	behaviour at high $z$ ($w \simeq 0$ at $z \sim 1$) to a strongly
	negative equation of state at present ($w \lleq -1$ at $z \simeq
	0$). Dark energy metamorphosis appears to be a robust phenomenon
	which manifests for a large variety of SNe data samples provided
	one does not invoke the weak energy prior $\rho + p \geq 0$. Invoking
	this prior considerably weakens the rate of growth of $w(z)$. These
	results demonstrate that dark energy with an evolving equation of
	state provides a compelling alternative to a cosmological constant
	if data are analysed in a prior-free manner and the weak energy condition
	is not imposed by hand.},

	in the South Galactic Cap in four optical bands, and to carry out
	repeat imaging over a smaller area to identify and measure lightcurves
	of Type Ia supernovae. The main imaging area overlaps the planned
	Sunyaev-Zel'dovich survey of the South Pole Telescope. The idea behind
	DES is to use four distinct and largely independent methods to probe
	the properties of dark energy: baryon oscillations of the power spectrum,
	abundance and spatial distribution of clusters, weak gravitational
	lensing, and Type Ia supernovae. This white paper outlines, in broad
	terms, some of the theoretical issues associated with the first three
	of these probes (the issues for supernovae are mostly different in
	character), and with the general task of characterizing dark energy
	and distinguishing it from alternative explanations for cosmic acceleration.
	A companion white paper discusses the kind of numerical simulations
	and other theoretical tools that will be needed to address the these
	issues and to create mock catalogs that allow end-to-end tests of
	analysis procedures. Although we have been thinking about these problems
	in the specific context of DES, many of them are also relevant to
	other planned dark energy studies.},

  year = {2010},

  abstract = {We investigate the regularity of cluster pressure profiles with REXCESS,
	a representative sample of 33 local (z < 0.2) clusters drawn from
	the REFLEX catalogue and observed with XMM-Newton. The sample spans
	a mass range of 1014 M&sun; < M500 < 1015 M&sun;, where M500 is the
	mass corresponding to a density contrast of 500. We derive an average
	profile from observations scaled by mass and redshift according to
	the standard self-similar model, and find that the dispersion about
	the mean is remarkably low, at less than 30 per cent beyond 0.2 R500,
	but increases towards the center. Deviations about the mean are related
	to both the mass and the thermo-dynamical state of the cluster. Morphologically
	disturbed systems have systematically shallower profiles while cooling
	core systems are more concentrated. The scaled profiles exhibit a
	residual mass dependence with a slope of ~0.12, consistent with that
	expected from the empirically-derived slope of the M500 - YX relation;
	however, the departure from standard scaling decreases with radius
	and is consistent with zero at R500. The scatter in the core and
	departure from self-similar mass scaling is smaller compared to that
	of the entropy profiles, showing that the pressure is the quantity
	least affected by dynamical history and non-gravitational physics.
	Comparison with scaled data from several state of the art numerical
	simulations shows good agreement outside the core. Combining the
	observational data in the radial range [0.03-1] R500 with simulation
	data in the radial range [1-4] R500, we derive a robust measure of
	the universal pressure profile, that, in an analytical form, defines
	the physical pressure profile of clusters as a function of mass and
	redshift up to the cluster "boundary". Using this profile and direct
	spherical integration of the observed pressure profiles, we estimate
	the integrated Compton parameter Y and investigate its scaling with
	M500 and LX, the soft band X-ray luminosity. We consider both the
	spherically integrated quantity, Ysph(R), proportional to the gas
	thermal energy, and the cylindrically integrated quantity, Ycyl(R)=YSZ
	DA2, which is directly related to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect
	signal. From the low scatter of the observed Ysph(R500) - YX relation
	we show that variations in pressure profile shape do not introduce
	extra scatter into the Ysph(R500) - M500 relation as compared to
	that from the YX - M500 relation. The Ysph(R500) - M500 and Ysph(R500)
	- LX relations derived from the data are in excellent agreement with
	those expected from the universal profile. This profile is used to
	derive the expected YSZ - M500 and YSZ - LX relations for any aperture.},

  abstract = {The first-year WMAP data taken at their face value hint that the Universe
	might be slightly positively curved and therefore necessarily finite,
	since all spherical (Clifford-Klein) space forms M^3 = S^3/Gamma,
	given by the quotient of S^3 by a group Gamma of covering transformations,
	possess this property. We examine the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave
	background (CMB) for all typical groups Gamma corresponding to homogeneous
	universes. The CMB angular power spectrum and the temperature correlation
	function are computed for the homogeneous spaces as a function of
	the total energy density parameter Omega_tot in the large range [1.01,
	1.20] and are compared with the WMAP data. We find that out of the
	infinitely many homogeneous spaces only the three corresponding to
	the binary dihedral group T*, the binary octahedral group O*, and
	the binary icosahedral group I* are in agreement with the WMAP observations.
	Furthermore, if Omega_tot is restricted to the interval [1.00, 1.04],
	the space described by T* is excluded since it requires a value of
	Omega_tot which is probably too large being in the range [1.06, 1.07].
	We thus conclude that there remain only the two homogeneous spherical
	spaces S^3/O* and S^3/I* with Omega_tot of about 1.038 and 1.018,

  abstract = {The usual interpretation of the quantum theory is self-consistent,
	but it involves an assumption that cannot be tested experimentally,
	viz., that the most complete possible specification of an individual
	system is in terms of a wave function that determines only probable
	results of actual measurement processes. The only way of investigating
	the truth of this assumption is by trying to find some other interpretation
	of the quantum theory in terms of at present "hidden" variables,
	which in principle determine the precise behavior of an individual
	system, but which are in practice averaged over in measurements of
	the types that can now be carried out. In this paper and in a subsequent
	paper, an interpretation of the quantum theory in terms of just such
	"hidden" variables is suggested. It is shown that as long as the
	mathematical theory retains its present general form, this suggested
	interpretation leads to precisely the same results for all physical
	processes as does the usual interpretation. Nevertheless, the suggested
	interpretation provides a broader conceptual framework than the usual
	interpretation, because it makes possible a precise and continuous
	description of all processes, even at the quantum level. This broader
	conceptual framework allows more general mathematical formulations
	of the theory than those allowed by the usual interpretation. Now,
	the usual mathematical formulation seems to lead to insoluble difficulties
	when it is extrapolated into the domain of distances of the order
	of 10-13 cm or less. It is therefore entirely possible that the interpretation
	suggested here may be needed for the resolution of these difficulties.
	In any case, the mere possibility of such an interpretation proves
	that it is not necessary for us to give up a precise, rational, and
	objective description of individual systems at a quantum level of

  abstract = {In this paper, we shall show how the theory of measurements is to
	be understood from the point of view of a physical interpretation
	of the quantum theory in terms of "hidden" variables, developed in
	a previous paper. We find that in principle, these "hidden" variables
	determine the precise results of each individual measurement process.
	In practice, however, in measurements that we now know how to carry
	out, the observing apparatus disturbs the observed system in an unpredictable
	and uncontrollable way, so that the uncertainty principle is obtained
	as a practical limitation on the possible precision of measurements.
	This limitation is not, however, inherent in the conceptual structure
	of our interpretation. We shall see, for example, that simultaneous
	measurements of position and momentum having unlimited precision
	would in principle be possible if, as suggested in the previous paper,
	the mathematical formulation of the quantum theory needs to be modified
	at very short distances in certain ways that are consistent with
	our interpretation but not with the usual interpretation. We give
	a simple explanation of the origin of quantum-mechanical correlations
	of distant objects in the hypothetical experiment of Einstein, Podolsky,
	and Rosen, which was suggested by these authors as a criticism of
	the usual interpretation. Finally, we show that von Neumann's proof
	that quantum theory is not consistent with hidden variables does
	not apply to our interpretation, because the hidden variables contemplated
	here depend both on the state of the measuring apparatus and the
	observed system and therefore go beyond certain of von Neumann's
	assumptions. In two appendixes, we treat the problem of the electromagnetic
	field in our interpretation and answer certain additional objections
	which have arisen in the attempt to give a precise description for
	an individual system at the quantum level.},

	derive a complete set of covariant linearized equations as they follow
	from the Bianchi and Ricci identities, and we show various possible
	ways of obtaining a second-order linear equation for the density
	perturbation variables. Then we systematically expand the covariant
	and gauge-invariant variables, recovering Bardeen's variables as
	first-order terms in this expansion: thus the two sets of variables
	are equivalent to first order. Through this comparison Bardeen's
	variables are shown to have a natural physical and geometrical meaning,
	which can be determined without the need of a gauge specification,

	fundamental sources to a homogeneous-geometry (FLRW) cosmology, can
	be potentially traced back to the inhomogeneous geometrical properties
	of space and its embedding into spacetime. We lay down a line of
	arguments that is -- thus far only qualitatively -- conclusive, and
	we address open problems of quantitative nature, related to the interpretation
	of observations. We discuss within a covariant framework (i) the
	foliation problem and invariant definitions of backreaction effects;
	(ii) the background problem and the notion of an effective cosmology;
	(iii) generalizations of the cosmological principle and generalizations
	of the cosmological equations; (iv) dark energies as energies of
	an effective scalar field; (v) the global gravitational instability

	effective metrics and strategies for effective distance measurements
	on the light cone, including observational predictions; (viii) examples
	of non-perturbative models, including explicit backreaction models
	for the LTB solution, extrapolations of the relativistic Lagrangian
	perturbation theory and scalar metric inhomogeneities. The role of
	scalar metric perturbations is critically examined and embedded into

	Under our most optimistic assumptions, we argue that the instability

	the cutoff is at or below 100 MeV. We conclude that it is difficult,

  abstract = {We perform a number of inter-related cosmographic fits to the legacy05
	and gold06 supernova datasets. We pay particular attention to the
	influence of both statistical and systematic uncertainties, and also
	to the extent to which the choice of distance scale and manner of
	representing the redshift scale affect the cosmological parameters.
	While the "preponderance of evidence" certainly suggests an accelerating
	universe, we would argue that (based on the supernova data) this
	conclusion is not currently supported "beyond reasonable doubt".
	As part of the analysis we develop two particularly transparent graphical
	representations of the redshift-distance relation -- representations
	in which acceleration versus deceleration reduces to the question
	of whether the graph slopes up or down. Turning to the details of
	the cosmographic fits, three issues in particular concern us: First,
	the fitted value for the deceleration parameter changes significantly
	depending on whether one performs a chi^2 fit to the luminosity distance,
	proper motion distance, angular diameter distance, or other suitable
	distance surrogate. Second, the fitted value for the deceleration
	parameter changes significantly depending on whether one uses the
	traditional redshift variable z, or what we shall argue is on theoretical
	grounds an improved parameterization y=z/(1+z). Third, the published
	estimates for systematic uncertainties are sufficiently large that
	they certainly impact on, and to a large extent undermine, the usual
	purely statistical tests of significance. We conclude that the case
	for an accelerating universe is considerably less watertight than
	commonly believed.},

  abstract = {Until recently, the physically relevant singularities occurring in
	FRW cosmologies had traditionally been thought to be limited to the
	"big bang", and possibly a "big crunch". However, over the last few
	years, the zoo of cosmological singularities considered in the literature
	has become considerably more extensive, with "big rips" and "sudden
	singularities" added to the mix, as well as renewed interest in non-singular
	cosmological events such as "bounces" and "turnarounds". In this
	talk, we present an extensive catalogue of such cosmological milestones,
	both at the kinematical and dynamical level. First, using generalized
	power series, purely kinematical definitions of these cosmological
	events are provided in terms of the behaviour of the scale factor
	a(t). The notion of a "scale-factor singularity" is defined, and
	its relation to curvature singularities (polynomial and differential)
	is explored. Second, dynamical information is extracted by using
	the Friedmann equations (without assuming even the existence of any
	equation of state) to place constraints on whether or not the classical
	energy conditions are satisfied at the cosmological milestones. Since
	the classification is extremely general, and modulo certain technical
	assumptions complete, the corresponding results are to a high degree
	model-independent.},

	for approximately 250000 galaxies. This paper describes the survey
	design, the spectroscopic observations, the redshift measurements

	on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which is capable of observing
	400 objects simultaneously over a 2° diameter field. The source catalogue
	for the survey is a revised and extended version of the APM galaxy
	catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with extinction-corrected
	magnitudes brighter than bJ=19.45. The main survey regions are two
	declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere spanning
	80°×15° around the SGP, and the other in the northern Galactic hemisphere
	spanning 75°×10° along the celestial equator; in addition, there
	are 99 fields spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers
	2000deg2 and has a median depth of z=0.11. Adaptive tiling is used
	to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93 per cent over the whole
	survey region. Redshifts are measured from spectra covering 3600-8000{Å}
	at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0{Å} and a median S/N of 13pixel-1.
	All redshift identifications are visually checked and assigned a
	quality parameter Q in the range 1-5 Q>=3 redshifts are 98.4 per
	cent reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85kms-1. The overall
	redshift completeness for Q>=3 redshifts is 91.8 per cent, but this

	that the physics of the bounce is not extremely sensitive to these
	corrections, perturbations can be evolved even at the nonlinear level.
	The resulting spectrum is not scale invariant and thus incompatible
	with experimental data. This can be explicitly shown in synchronous

	gauge, all perturbations remain small going towards the bounce and
	the existence of the attractor is manifest.},

	The weighting procedure also naturally indicates which galaxies in

	namely those that lie in regions of photometric-observable space
	that are well sampled by the spectroscopic subsample. In addition
	to providing a method that has some advantages over standard photo-z
	estimates, the weights method can also be used in conjunction with
	photo-z estimates, e.g., by providing improved estimation of N(z)

  abstract = {We introduce a large class of scalar-tensor models with interactions
	containing the second derivatives of the scalar field but not leading
	to additional degrees of freedom. These models exhibit peculiar features,
	such as an essential mixing of scalar and tensor kinetic terms, which
	we have named kinetic braiding. This braiding causes the scalar stress
	tensor to deviate from the perfect-fluid form. Cosmology in these
	models possesses a rich phenomenology, even in the limit where the
	scalar is an exact Goldstone boson. Generically, there are attractor
	solutions where the scalar monitors the behaviour of external matter.
	Because of the kinetic braiding, the position of the attractor depends
	both on the form of the Lagrangian and on the external energy density.
	The late-time asymptotic of these cosmologies is a de Sitter state.
	The scalar can exhibit phantom behaviour and is able to cross the
	phantom divide with neither ghosts nor gradient instabilities. These
	features provide a new class of models for Dark Energy. As an example,
	we study in detail a simple one-parameter model. The possible observational
	signatures of this model include a sizeable Early Dark Energy and
	a specific equation of state evolving into the final de-Sitter state

  abstract = {We reexamine the two-point correlation of density maxima in Gaussian
	initial conditions. Spatial derivatives of the linear density correlation,
	which were ignored in the calculation of Bardeen, Bond, Kaiser &
	Szalay (1986), are included in our analysis. These functions exhibit
	large oscillations around the sound horizon scale for generic CDM
	power spectra. We derive the exact leading-order expression for the
	correlation of density peaks and demonstrate the contribution of
	those spatial derivatives. In particular, we show that these functions
	can modify significantly the baryon acoustic signature of density
	maxima relative to that of the linear density field. The effect depends
	upon the exact value of the peak height, the filter shape and size,
	and the small-scale behaviour of the transfer function. In the LambdaCDM
	cosmology, for maxima identified in the density field smoothed at
	mass scale M\approx 10^{12}-10^{14}M_sun/h and with linear threshold
	height \nu=1.673/\sigma(M), the contrast of the BAO can be a few
	tens of percent larger than in the linear matter correlation. Overall,
	the BAO is amplified (damped) for threshold heights larger (less)
	than unity. Density maxima thus behave quite differently than linearly
	biased tracers of the density field, whose acoustic signature is
	a simple scaled version of the linear baryon acoustic oscillation.
	We also calculate the mean streaming of peak pairs in the quasi-linear
	regime. We show that the leading-order 2-point correlation and pairwise
	velocity of density peaks are consistent with a nonlinear, local
	biasing relation involving gradients of the density field. Biasing
	will be an important issue in ascertaining how much of the enhancement
	of the BAO in the primeval correlation of density maxima propagates
	into the late-time clustering of galaxies.},

	separation. The density profiles of 26 high resolution clusters obtained

	very well. The average logarithmic slope at one percent of the virial
	radius is $\gamma = 1.26$ with a scatter of $\pm 0.17$. Over the

  abstract = {We provide scaling relations and fitting formulae for adiabatic cold
	dark matter cosmologies that account for all baryon effects in the
	matter transfer function to better than 10\% in the large-scale structure
	regime. They are based upon a physically well-motivated separation
	of the effects of acoustic oscillations, Compton drag, velocity overshoot,
	baryon infall, adiabatic damping, Silk damping, and cold-dark-matter
	growth suppression. We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better
	motivated form for the zero baryon transfer function than previous
	works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude
	and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic
	oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction exceeds $\Omega_0
	h^2 + 0.2$, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a
	sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon.
	We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress
	that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter
	$\Gamma$.},

  abstract = {We present the large-scale correlation function measured from a spectroscopic
	sample of 46,748 luminous red galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
	Survey. The survey region covers 0.72 h^{-3} Gpc^3 over 3816 square
	degrees and 0.16<z<0.47, making it the best sample yet for the study
	of large-scale structure. We find a well-detected peak in the correlation
	function at 100h^{-1} Mpc separation that is an excellent match to
	the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch
	acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This
	detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational
	instability between z=1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction
	of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a
	standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances
	to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4\% fractional accuracy and the absolute
	distance to z=0.35 to 5\% accuracy. From the overall shape of the
	correlation function, we measure the matter density Omega_mh^2 to
	8\% and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background
	(CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the
	CMB acoustic scale, we find Omega_m = 0.273 +- 0.025 + 0.123 (1+w_0)
	+ 0.137 Omega_K. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the
	spatial curvature is Omega_K=-0.010+-0.009 if the dark energy is
	a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement
	of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy,
	based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave
	background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly
	passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

  abstract = {It has been known for a long time that the gauge problem plagues the
	study of density perturbations in cosmology. The quantity $\delta\mu/\mu
	(the fractional variation in density along a world line) usually
	determined in perturbation calculations is completely dependent on
	the gauge chosen. Even the fully covariant approach of Hawking (1966)
	is not immune. Bardeen's major paper (1980) determines a set of gauge-invariant
	quantities that are related to density perturbations but are not
	those perturbations themselves. We give a simple alternative representation
	of density fluctuations. This representation is both fully covariant
	and gauge invariant; thus it sidesteps the usual problems. The basic
	quantity used to represent density inhomogeneities is the comoving
	fractional gradient of the energy density orthogonal to the fluid
	flow. Our description does not make the usual assumption that this
	gradient is small. Exact (fully nonlinear) propagation equations
	are derived for this quantity. They are then linearized to give propagation
	equations appropriate to the case of an almost-Robertson-Walker universe.
	Their solutions are obtained in a simple case which can be compared
	with the standard theory; we recover the usual growing and decaying
	modes. Thus the result is standard, but its derivation is completely
	transparent. We give an interpretation of the Bardeen variables in
	terms of our formalism.},

	Project to measure the Hubble constant. We summarize our method,
	the results and the uncertainties, tabulate our revised distances,
	and give the implications of these results for cosmology. The analysis
	presented here benefits from a number of recent improvements and
	refinements, including (1) a larger LMC Cepheid sample to define
	the fiducial period-luminosity (PL) relations, (2) a more recent
	HST Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) photometric calibration,
	(3) a correction for Cepheid metallicity, and (4) a correction for
	incompleteness bias in the observed Cepheid PL samples. New, revised
	distances are given for the 18 spiral galaxies for which Cepheids
	have been discovered as part of the Key Project, as well as for 13
	additional galaxies with published Cepheid data. The new calibration
	results in a Cepheid distance to NGC 4258 in better agreement with
	the maser distance to this galaxy. Based on these revised Cepheid
	distances, we find values (in km/sec/Mpc) of H0 = 71 +/- 2 (random)
	+/- 6 (systematic) (type Ia supernovae), 71 +/- 2 +/- 7 (Tully-Fisher
	relation), 70 +/- 5 +/- 6 (surface brightness fluctuations), 72 +/-
	9 +/- 7 (type II supernovae), and 82 +/- 6 +/- 9 (fundamental plane).
	We combine these results for the different methods with 3 different
	weighting schemes, and find good agreement and consistency with H0
	= 72 +/- 8. Finally, we compare these results with other, global
	methods for measuring the Hubble constant.},

	The energy density required to close the universe is much smaller

	provide a flat geometry. The new term required may arise, e.g., as
	a consequence of our observable universe living as a 3-dimensional

	The goal of this comparison is to assess the reliability of cosmological
	gas dynamical simulations of clusters in the simplest astrophysically
	relevant case, that in which the gas is assumed to be non-radiative.
	We compare images of the cluster at different epochs, global properties
	such as mass, temperature and X-ray luminosity, and radial profiles
	of various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. On the whole,
	the agreement among the various simulations is gratifying although
	a number of discrepancies exist. Agreement is best for properties
	of the dark matter and worst for the total X-ray luminosity. Even
	in this case, simulations that adequately resolve the core radius
	of the gas distribution predict total X-ray luminosities that agree
	to within a factor of two. Other quantities are reproduced to much
	higher accuracy. For example, the temperature and gas mass fraction
	within the virial radius agree to about 10\%, and the ratio of specific
	kinetic to thermal energies of the gas agree to about 5\%. Various
	factors contribute to the spread in calculated cluster properties,
	including differences in the internal timing of the simulations.
	Based on the overall consistency of results, we discuss a number

	but it is not adequate for quantizing perturbations in the one-bubble
	universe, because of the lack of Cauchy surfaces inside the bubble.
	Therefore we perform the reduction of the action outside the light
	cone emanating from the center of the bubble or nucleation event,
	where the natural time constant hypersurfaces are no longer homogeneous
	and isotropic and as a result the conventional classification of
	perturbations in terms of scalar and tensor modes is not possible.
	Nevertheless, after reduction of the action we find three decoupled
	actions for three independent degrees of freedom, one of which corresponds
	to the scalar mode and the other two to the tensor modes. Implications
	for the one-bubble open inflationary models are briefly discussed.
	As an application of our formalism, the spectrum of long-wavelength
	gravity waves is simply obtained in terms of the real part of the
	reflection amplitude for a one-dimensional scattering problem, where
	the potential barrier is given in terms of the bubble profile.},

	a unified description of known cases such as the usual scalar field
	and the hydrodynamical perfect fluid. In addition, it applies to
	the recently proposed k-inflation, which is driven by non-minimal
	kinetic terms in the Lagrangian. The spectrum of quantum fluctuations
	for slow-roll and power law k-inflation is calculated. We find, for
	instance, that the usual ``consistency relation'' between the tensor
	spectral index and the relative amplitude of scalar and tensor perturbations
	is modified. Thus, at least in principle, k-inflation is phenomenologically
	distinguishable from standard inflation.},

  abstract = {Recent observations suggest that the ratio of the total density to
	the critical density of the universe, $\Omega_0$, is likely to be
	very close to one, with a significant proportion of this energy being
	in the form of a dark component with negative pressure. Motivated
	by this result, we study the question of observational detection
	of possible non-trivial topologies in universes with $\Omega_0 \sim
	1$, which include a cosmological constant. Using a number of indicators
	we find that as $\Omega_0 \to 1$, increasing families of possible
	manifolds (topologies) become either undetectable or can be excluded
	observationally. Furthermore, given a non-zero lower bound on $|\Omega_0
	- 1|$, we can rule out families of topologies (manifolds) as possible
	candidates for the shape of our universe. We demonstrate these findings
	concretely by considering families of topologies and employing bounds

	holds for all Robertson-Walker spacetimes and gives rise to two basic

	same translations in their covering groups exhibit identical spike
	spectra of topological origin, making clear that even if the universe
	is flat the topological spikes alone are not sufficient for determining
	its topology; and (ii) that PSH's of hyperbolic 3-manifolds exhibit
	no spikes of topological origin. These corollaries ensure that cosmic

  abstract = {The energy conditions provide a very promising model-independent study

	connect these conditions with observations, one often needs first
	to integrate them, and then find the corresponding constraints on
	some observational variables, such as the distance modulus. Those
	integral forms can be misleading, and great caution is needed when
	one interprets them physically. A typical example is that the transition
	point of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ is at about $z \simeq
	0.76$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, with the same model when
	we consider the dimensionless Hubble parameter $E(z)$, which involves
	the integration of $q(z)$, we find that $E(z)$ does not cross the
	line of $q(z) = 0$ before $z = 2$. Therefore, to get the correct
	result, we cannot use the latter to determine the transition point.
	With these in mind, we carefully study the constraints from the energy
	conditions, and find that, among other things, the current observational
	data indeed strongly indicate that our universe has ocne experienced

	to those found either in studies of cosmic microwave background (CMB)
	anisotropies or of high-redshift supernovae (SNe). As a result, combining
	these surveys together with either CMB or SNe studies can reduce
	the statistical uncertainty on both w and m to levels below what
	could be obtained by combining only the latter two data sets. Our
	results indicate a formal statistical uncertainty of ~3% (68% confidence)
	on both m and w when the SZE survey is combined with either the CMB
	or SN data; the large number of clusters in the X-ray survey further
	suppresses the degeneracy between w and both m and h. Systematics
	and internal evolution of cluster structure at the present pose uncertainties
	above these levels. We briefly discuss and quantify the relevant
	systematic errors. By focusing on clusters with measured temperatures
	in the X-ray survey, we reduce our sensitivity to systematics such
	as nonstandard evolution of internal cluster structure.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the two-point correlation function,
	from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). We estimate the redshift-space
	correlation function, xi(s), from which we measure the redshift-space
	clustering length, s_0=6.82+/-0.28 Mpc/h. We also estimate the projected
	correlation function, Xi(sigma), and the real-space correlation function,
	xi(r), which can be fit by a power-law, with r_0=5.05+/-0.26Mpc/h,
	gamma_r=1.67+/-0.03. For r>20Mpc/h, xi drops below a power-law as
	is expected in the popular LCDM model. The ratio of amplitudes of
	the real and redshift-space correlation functions on scales of 8-30Mpc/h
	gives an estimate of the redshift-space distortion parameter beta.
	The quadrupole moment of xi on scales 30-40Mpc/h provides another
	estimate of beta. We also estimate the distribution function of pairwise
	peculiar velocities, f(v), including rigorously the effect of infall
	velocities, and find that it is well fit by an exponential. The accuracy
	of our xi measurement is sufficient to constrain a model, which simultaneously
	fits the shape and amplitude of xi(r) and the two redshift-space
	distortion effects parameterized by beta and velocity dispersion,
	a. We find beta=0.49+/-0.09 and a=506+/-52km/s, though the best fit
	values are strongly correlated. We measure the variation of the peculiar
	velocity dispersion with projected separation, a(sigma), and find
	that the shape is consistent with models and simulations. Using the
	constraints on bias from recent estimates, and taking account of
	redshift evolution, we conclude that beta(L=L*,z=0)=0.47+/-0.08,
	and that the present day matter density of the Universe is 0.3, consistent
	with other 2dFGRS estimates and independent analyses.},

  title = {Relativistic thermodynamics},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {A generally relativistic theory of thermodynamics is developed, based
	on four main physical principles: heat is a local form of energy,
	therefore described by a thermal energy tensor; conservation of mass,
	equivalent to conservation of heat, or the local first law; entropy
	is a local current; and non-destruction of entropy, or the local
	second law. A fluid is defined by the thermostatic energy tensor
	being isotropic. The entropy current is related to the other fields
	by certain equations, including a generalised Gibbs equation for
	the thermostatic entropy, followed by linear and quadratic terms
	in the dissipative (thermal minus thermostatic) energy tensor. Then
	the second law suggests certain equations for the dissipative energy
	tensor, generalising the Israel- Stewart dissipative relations, which
	describe heat conduction and viscosity including relativistic effects
	and relaxation effects. In the thermostatic case, the perfect-fluid
	model is recovered. In the linear approximation for entropy, the
	Eckart theory is recovered. In the quadratic approximation for entropy,
	the theory is similar to that of Israel & Stewart, but involving
	neither state-space differentials, nor a non-equilibrium Gibbs equation,
	nor non-material frames. Also, unlike conventional thermodynamics,
	the thermal energy density is not assumed to be purely thermostatic,
	though this is derived in the linear approximation. Otherwise, the
	theory reduces in the non- relativistic limit to the extended thermodynamics
	of irreversible processes due to Mueller. The dissipative energy
	density seems to be a new thermodynamical field, but also exists
	in relativistic kinetic theory of gases.},

	In order to obtain theoretical predictions in these regimes, large

	This requirement can only be fulfilled by carrying out an extensive

	comparison of different cosmology codes including gravitation interactions
	only. In this paper we extend a recently carried out code comparison
	project to include five more simulation codes. We restrict our analysis
	to a small cosmological volume which allows us to investigate properties
	of halos. For the matter power spectrum and the mass function, the
	previous results hold, with the codes agreeing at the 10\% level
	over wide dynamic ranges. We extend our analysis to the comparison
	of halo profiles and investigate the halo count as a function of
	local density. We introduce and discuss ParaView as a flexible analysis
	tool for cosmological simulations, the use of which immensely simplifies
	the code comparison task.},

  abstract = {The gravitationally-driven evolution of cold dark matter dominates
	the formation of structure in the Universe over a wide range of length
	scales. While the longest scales can be treated by perturbation theory,
	a fully quantitative understanding of nonlinear effects requires
	the application of large-scale particle simulation methods. Additionally,
	precision predictions for next-generation observations, such as weak
	gravitational lensing, can only be obtained from numerical simulations.
	In this paper, we compare results from several N-body codes using
	test problems and a diverse set of diagnostics, focusing on a medium
	resolution regime appropriate for studying many observationally relevant
	aspects of structure formation. Our conclusions are that -- despite
	the use of different algorithms and error-control methodologies --
	overall, the codes yield consistent results. The agreement over a
	wide range of scales for the cosmological tests is test-dependent.
	In the best cases, it is at the 5\% level or better, however, for
	other cases it can be significantly larger than 10\%. These include
	the halo mass function at low masses and the mass power spectrum
	at small scales. While there exist explanations for most of the discrepancies,

	define the bounce in terms of a three-dimensional edgeless achronal
	spacelike hypersurface of minimal volume. (Zero trace for the extrinsic
	curvature plus a "flare-out" condition.) This enables us to severely
	constrain the geometry of spacetime at and near the bounce and to
	derive general theorems regarding violations of the energy conditions--theorems
	that do not involve geodesic averaging but nevertheless apply to
	situations much more general than the highly symmetric FRW-based
	subclass of Tolman wormholes. [For example: even under the mildest
	of hypotheses, the strong energy condition (SEC) must be violated.]
	Alternatively, one can dispense with the minimal volume condition
	and define a generic bounce entirely in terms of the motion of test
	particles (future-pointing timelike geodesics), by looking at the
	expansion of their timelike geodesic congruences. One re-confirms
	that the SEC must be violated at or near the bounce. In contrast,
	it is easy to arrange for all the other standard energy conditions
	to be satisfied.},

	Second, the survey sky area is divided into 10 disjoint solid angular

	in the redshift range 0.2<z<0.35 among these (~2×107h-3Mpc3) regions

	be detected at any redshift, with the exact limit showing a modest
	redshift dependence. Using a Press-Schechter prescription for evolving

	accessible to SZE surveys. Currently favored cosmological models

  abstract = {The distribution of dark matter in the halos that surround galaxies
	and galaxy clusters has been probed observationally, theoretically,
	and in numerical simulations. Yet there is still confusion about
	which of several suggested parameterized models is the better representation,
	and whether these models are truly universal. We use the observed
	temperature and density profiles of the intracluster medium of 11
	relaxed galaxy clusters to investigate mass models for the dark matter
	halo using a thorough statistical analysis. We make careful comparisons
	between two- and three-parameter models, including the issue of a
	universal third parameter. We find that, of the two-parameter models,
	the NFW is still the best representation, but we also find moderate
	statistical evidence that a generalized three-parameter NFW model
	with a freely varying inner slope is preferred, despite penalizing
	against the extra degree of freedom. There is a strong indication
	that this inner slope needs to be determined for each cluster individually,
	some clusters have central cores and others have steep cusps. This
	implies that X-ray observations do not support the idea of a universal
	inner slope, but perhaps show a hint of a dependence with redshift
	or mass. The mass-concentration relation of our sample is in reasonable
	agreement with the latest predictions based on numerical simulations.},

	Baryon drag on the photons causes alternating acoustic peak heights

	scale. Decoupling of the photons at last scattering and of the baryons
	at the end of the Compton drag epoch, freezes the diffusion-damped

	with CDM fluctuations in the present matter power spectrum. We present
	new exact analytic solutions for the cold dark matter fluctuations

  pages = {123527},
  abstract = {The presence of dark energy in the Universe is inferred directly from
	the accelerated expansion of the Universe, and indirectly, from measurements
	of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. Dark energy contributes
	about 2/3 of the critical density, is very smoothly distributed,
	and has large negative pressure. Its nature is very much unknown.
	Most of its discernible consequences follow from its effect on evolution
	of the expansion rate of the Universe, which in turn affects the
	growth of density perturbations and the age of the Universe, and
	can be probed by the classical kinematic cosmological tests. Absent
	a compelling theoretical model (or even a class of models), we describe
	the dark energy by an effective equation-of-state w=p_X/\rho_X which
	is allowed to vary with time. We describe and compare different approaches
	for determining w(t), including magnitude-redshift (Hubble) diagram,
	number counts of galaxies and clusters, and CMB anisotropy, focusing
	particular attention on the use of a sample of several thousand type
	Ia supernova with redshifts z\lesssim 1.7, as might be gathered by
	the proposed SNAP satellite. Among other things, we derive optimal
	strategies for constraining cosmological parameters using type Ia
	supernovae. While in the near term CMB anisotropy will provide the
	first measurements of w, supernovae and number counts appear to have
	the most potential to probe dark energy.},

	including non-linear shear and the fact that cluster halos are not
	all precisely centered on their brightest galaxies. We also model
	the measured cluster shear profile as a sum of contributions from
	the brightest central galaxy, the cluster dark matter halo, and neighboring
	halos. We infer the relations between mean cluster virial mass and
	optical richness and luminosity over two orders of magnitude in cluster
	mass; the virial mass at fixed richness or luminosity is determined
	with a precision of 13\% including both statistical and systematic
	errors. We also constrain the halo concentration parameter and halo
	bias as a function of cluster mass; both are in good agreement with
	predictions of LCDM models. The methods employed here will be applicable
	to deeper, wide-area optical surveys that aim to constrain the nature
	of the dark energy, such as the Dark Energy Survey, the Large Synoptic
	Survey Telescope and space-based surveys.},

	minimal LCDM model. We constrain the physics of inflation via Gaussianity,
	adiabaticity, the power spectrum shape, gravitational waves, and
	spatial curvature. We also constrain the properties of dark energy,
	parity-violation, and neutrinos. We detect no convincing deviations
	from the minimal model. The parameters of the LCDM model, derived
	from WMAP combined with the distance measurements from the Type Ia
	supernovae (SN) and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), are:
	Omega_b=0.0456+-0.0015, Omega_c=0.228+-0.013, Omega_Lambda=0.726+-0.015,
	H_0=70.5+-1.3 km/s/Mpc, n_s=0.960+-0.013, tau=0.084+-0.016, and sigma_8=0.812+-0.026.
	With WMAP+BAO+SN, we find the tensor-to-scalar ratio r<0.22 (95\%
	CL), and n_s>1 is disfavored regardless of r. We obtain tight, simultaneous
	limits on the (constant) equation of state of dark energy and curvature.
	We provide a set of "WMAP distance priors," to test a variety of
	dark energy models. We test a time-dependent w with a present value
	constrained as -0.33<1+w_0<0.21 (95\% CL). Temperature and matter
	fluctuations obey the adiabatic relation to within 8.9\% and 2.1\%
	for the axion and curvaton-type dark matter, respectively. The TE
	and EB spectra constrain cosmic parity-violation. We find the limit
	on the total mass of neutrinos, sum(m_nu)<0.67 eV (95\% CL), which
	is free from the uncertainty in the normalization of the large-scale
	structure data. The effective number of neutrino species is constrained
	as N_{eff} = 4.4+-1.5 (68\%), consistent with the standard value
	of 3.04. Finally, limits on primordial non-Gaussianity are -9<f_NL^{local}<111
	and -151<f_NL^{equil}<253 (95\% CL) for the local and equilateral
	models, respectively.},

  title = {Improved Cosmological Constraints from New, Old and Combined Supernova
	Datasets},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {We present a new compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), a new
	dataset of low-redshift nearby-Hubble-flow SNe and new analysis procedures
	to work with these heterogeneous compilations. This ``Union'' compilation
	of 414 SN Ia, which reduces to 307 SNe after selection cuts, includes
	the recent large samples of SNe Ia from the Supernova Legacy Survey
	and ESSENCE Survey, the older datasets, as well as the recently extended
	dataset of distant supernovae observed with HST. A single, consistent
	and blind analysis procedure is used for all the various SN Ia subsamples,
	and a new procedure is implemented that consistently weights the
	heterogeneous data sets and rejects outliers. We present the latest
	results from this Union compilation and discuss the cosmological
	constraints from this new compilation and its combination with other
	cosmological measurements (CMB and BAO). The constraint we obtain
	from supernovae on the dark energy density is $\Omega_\Lambda= 0.713^{+0.027}_{-0.029}
	(stat)^{+0.036}_{-0.039} (sys)$, for a flat, LCDM Universe. Assuming
	a constant equation of state parameter, $w$, the combined constraints
	from SNe, BAO and CMB give $w=-0.969^{+0.059}_{-0.063}(stat)^{+0.063}_{-0.066}
	(sys)$. While our results are consistent with a cosmological constant,
	we obtain only relatively weak constraints on a $w$ that varies with
	redshift. In particular, the current SN data do not yet significantly
	constrain $w$ at $z>1$. With the addition of our new nearby Hubble-flow
	SNe Ia, these resulting cosmological constraints are currently the
	tightest available.},

	Instead, it assigns weights to galaxies in a spectroscopic subsample
	such that the weighted distributions of photometric observables (e.g.,
	multi-band magnitudes) match the corresponding distributions for
	the photometric sample. The weights are estimated using a nearest-neighbor
	technique that ensures stability in sparsely populated regions of
	color-magnitude space. The derived weights are then summed in redshift
	bins to create the redshift distribution. We apply this weighting
	technique to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as well as to
	mock catalogs for the Dark Energy Survey, and compare the results
	to those from the estimation of photo-z's derived by a neural network
	algorithm. We find that the weighting method accurately recovers
	the underlying redshift distribution, typically better than the photo-z
	reconstruction, provided the spectroscopic subsample spans the range
	of photometric observables covered by the photometric sample.},

  abstract = {The ability to constrain dark energy from the evolution of galaxy
	cluster counts is limited by the imperfect knowledge of cluster redshifts.
	Ongoing and upcoming surveys will mostly rely on redshifts estimated
	from broad-band photometry (photo-z's). For a Gaussian distribution
	for the cluster photo-z errors and a high cluster yield cosmology
	defined by the WMAP 1 year results, the photo-z bias and scatter
	needs to be known better than 0.003 and 0.03, respectively, in order
	not to degrade dark energy constrains by more than 10\% for a survey
	with specifications similar to the South Pole Telescope. Smaller
	surveys and cosmologies with lower cluster yields produce weaker
	photo-z requirements, though relative to worse baseline constraints.
	Comparable photo-z requirements are necessary in order to employ
	self-calibration techniques when solving for dark energy and observable-mass
	parameters simultaneously. On the other hand, self-calibration in
	combination with external mass inferences helps reduce photo-z requirements
	and provides important consistency checks for future cluster surveys.
	In our fiducial model, training sets with spectroscopic redshifts
	for ~5\%-15\% of the detected clusters are required in order to keep
	degradations in the dark energy equation of state lower than 20\%.},

	of the dark energy implies a comparable sensitivity to not only the
	mean but also the actual_distribution_ of an observable mass proxy
	given the true cluster mass. For example a 25\% scatter in mass can
	provide a ~50\% change in the number counts at z~2 for the upcoming
	SPT survey. Uncertainty in the scatter of this amount would degrade
	dark energy constraints to uninteresting levels. Given the shape
	of the actual mass function, the properties of the distribution may
	be internally monitored by the shape of the_observable_ mass function.
	An arbitrary evolution of the scatter of a mass-independent Gaussian
	distribution may be self-calibrated to allow a measurement of the
	dark energy equation of state of Delta w ~0.1. External constraints
	on the mass_variance_ of the distribution that are more accurate
	than Delta var < 0.01 at z~1 can further improve constraints by up
	to a factor of 2. More generally, cluster counts and their sample
	variance measured as a function of the observable provide internal
	consistency checks on the assumed form of the observable-mass distribution
	that will protect against misinterpretation of the dark energy constraints.},

  abstract = {The energy conditions play an important role in the understanding
	of several properties of the Universe, including the current accelerating
	expansion phase and the possible existence of the so-called phantom
	fields. We show that the integrated bounds provided by the energy
	conditions on cosmological observables such as the distance modulus
	$\mu(z)$ and the lookback time $t_L(z)$ are not sufficient (nor necessary)
	to ensure the local fulfillment of the energy conditions, making
	explicit the limitation of these bounds in the confrontation with
	observational data. We recast the energy conditions as bounds on
	the deceleration and normalized Hubble parameters, obtaining new
	bounds which are necessary and sufficient for the local fulfillment
	of the energy conditions. A statistical confrontation, with $1\sigma-3\sigma$
	confidence levels, between our bounds and supernovae data from the
	gold and combined samples is made for the recent past. Our analyses
	indicate, with $3\sigma$ confidence levels, the fulfillment of both
	the weak energy condition (WEC) and dominant energy condition (DEC)
	for $z \leq 1$ and $z \lesssim 0.8$, respectively. In addition, they
	suggest a possible recent violation of the null energy condition
	(NEC) with $3\sigma$, i.e. a very recent phase of super-acceleration.
	Our analyses also show the possibility of violation of the strong
	energy condition (\textbfSEC) with $3\sigma$ in the recent past ($z
	\leq 1$), but interestingly the $q(z)$-best-fit curve crosses the
	SEC-fulfillment divider at $z \simeq 0.67$, which is a value very
	close to the beginning of the epoch of cosmic acceleration predicted
	by the standard concordance flat $\Lambda$CDM scenario.},

	the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) confirm this model
	to spectacular precision on all but the largest scales (Bennett {\it

	across the microwave sky match expectations on scales narrower than
	$60^{\circ}$, yet vanish on scales wider than $60^{\circ}$. Researchers
	are now seeking an explanation of the missing wide-angle correlations
	(Contaldi {\it et al.}, 2003 ; Cline {\it et al.}, 2003). One natural
	approach questions the underlying geometry of space, namely its curvature
	(Efstathiou, 2003) and its topology (Tegmark {\it et al.}, 2003).
	In an infinite flat space, waves from the big bang would fill the
	universe on all length scales. The observed lack of temperature correlations
	on scales beyond $60^{\circ}$ means the broadest waves are missing,
	perhaps because space itself is not big enough to support them. Here
	we present a simple geometrical model of a finite, positively curved
	space -- the Poincar\'e dodecahedral space -- which accounts for
	WMAP's observations with no fine-tuning required. Circle searching
	(Cornish, Spergel and Starkman, 1998) may confirm the model's topological
	predictions, while upcoming Planck Surveyor data may confirm its
	predicted density of $\Omega_0 \simeq 1.013 > 1$. If confirmed, the

	phase-space description is given to the photons and neutrinos. Particular
	care is applied to the massive neutrino component, which has been

	initial conditions on superhorizon scales are derived. The coupled,

  abstract = {We examine the prospects for measuring the dark energy equation of
	state parameter w within the context of any uncertain redshift evolution
	of galaxy cluster structure (building on Majumdar and Mohr, 2003)
	and show that including the redshift averaged cluster power spectrum,
	P_cl(k), and direct mass measurements of 100 clusters helps tremendously
	in reducing cosmological parameter uncertainties. Specifically, we
	show that when combining the redshift distribution and the power
	spectrum information for a particular X-ray survey (DUET) and two
	SZE surveys (SPT & Planck), the constraints on the dark energy equation
	of state w can be improved by roughly a factor of 4. Because surveys
	designed to study the redshift distribution of clusters will have
	all the information necessary to construct P_cl(k), the benefit of
	adding P_cl(k) in reducing uncertainties comes at no additional observational
	cost. Combining detailed mass studies of 100 clusters with the redshift
	distribution improves the parameter uncertainties by a factor of
	3-5. The data required for these detailed mass measurements-- assumed
	to have 1sigma uncertainties of 30-- are accumulating in the the
	XMM-Newton and Chandra archives. The best constraints are obtained
	when one combines both the power spectrum constraints and mass measurements
	with the cluster redshift distribution; when using the survey to
	extract the parameters and evolution of the mass--observable relations,
	we estimate the uncertainties on w of ~4\% to 6\%. These parameter
	constraints are obtained from self-calibrating cluster surveys alone.
	In combination with CMB or distance measurements that have different
	parameter degeneracies, cluster studies of dark energy will provide
	enhanced constraints and allow for cross--checks of systematics.},

  abstract = {Cosmic crystallography is based on the principle that peaks in the
	pair separation histogram (PSH) of objects in a catalogue should
	be induced by the high number of topologically lensed pairs that
	are separated by Clifford translations, in excess to ``random'' pairs
	of objects. Here we present modifications of this method that successively
	improve the signal-to-noise ratio by removing a large part of the
	noise and then false signals induced by selection effects. Given
	the transient nature of the most readily available tracer objects,
	active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the former is possible because a natural
	filter for removing many of the noise pairs is available: when counting
	pairs of objects in order to create PSHs, only those with nearly
	identical redshifts need to be counted. This redshift filter (a maximum
	value of $\Delta z/z = 0.005$) was applied to a compilation of AGN
	catalogues. Further noise was removed by applying a second filter,
	a maximum angle $\Delta \theta =0.075$ rad, and a minimum number
	of pairs $\protect\npairs=3$ to find each ``bunch of pairs'' (BoP)
	where the {\em vectors} (in Euclidean comoving space) defined by
	pairs are required to be nearly equal, whereas in the PSH only the
	{\em lengths} must be nearly equal. These filters reveal significant
	signals, which, however, are due to selection effects. A third filter,
	a minimum length $\Lselec=150$ {\hMpc} between the (parallel) vectors
	in a BoP, is found to effectively remove these selection effect pairs.
	After application of these successive filters, no significant topological
	signal was found.},

  abstract = {In most current models of inflation based on a weakly self-coupled
	scalar matter field minimally coupled to gravity, the period of inflation
	lasts so long that, at the beginning of the inflationary period,
	the physical wavelengths of comoving scales which correspond to the
	present large-scale structure of the Universe were smaller than the
	Planck length. Thus, the usual computations of the spectrum of fluctuations
	in these models involve extrapolating low-energy physics (both in
	the matter and gravitational sector) into regions where this physics
	is not applicable. In this article we study the dependence of the
	usual predictions of inflation for the spectrum of cosmological fluctuations
	on the hidden assumptions about super-Planck scale physics. We introduce
	a class of modified dispersion relations to mimic possible effects
	of super-Planck scale physics, and find that, given an initial state
	determined by minimizing the energy density, for dispersions relations
	introduced by Unruh the spectrum is unchanged, whereas for a class
	of dispersion relations similar to those used by Corley and Jacobson
	(which involve a more radical departure from the usual linear relation)
	important deviations from the usual predictions of inflation can
	be obtained. Some implications of this result for the unification
	of fundamental physics and early Universe cosmology are discussed.},

	We also show that this prescription does not reproduce the exact

	that, in the only case where a bounce can be obtained in Einstein

	short. This contrasts with the standard (inflationary) situation
	where the transition between two eras with different values of the
	equation of state can be considered as instantaneous. We then argue
	that the usually conserved quantities are not constant on a typical
	bounce time scale. Finally, we also examine the case of a test scalar

	The logarithmic density slopes gamma = d(log rho)/d(log r) of the
	LCDM halos are found to vary as power-laws in radius, reaching values
	of gamma ~ -1 at the innermost resolved radii (~0.01 r_virial). This
	behavior is significantly different from that of broken power-law
	models like the NFW profile, but similar to that of models like de
	Vaucouleurs'. Accordingly, we compare the N-body density profiles
	with various parametric models to find which provide the best fit.
	We consider an NFW-like model with arbitrary inner slope; Dehnen
	& McLaughlin's anisotropic model; Einasto's model (identical in functional
	form to Sersic's model but fit to the space density); and the density
	model of Prugniel & Simien that was designed to match the deprojected

	the LCDM halos is Einasto's, although the Prugniel-Simien and Dehnen-McLaughlin
	models also perform well. With regard to the spherical collapse halos,
	both the Prugniel-Simien and Einasto models describe the density
	profiles well, with an rms scatter some four times smaller than that
	obtained with either the NFW-like model or the 3-parameter Dehnen-McLaughlin

	are calculated analytically in most interesting cases. The analysis
	is applied to study the evolution of fluctuations in inflationary

	of the action for cosmological perturbations which has been reduced
	to an expression in terms of a single gauge-invariant variable. The
	spectrum of density perturbations originating in quantum fluctuations
	is calculated in universe with hydrodynamical matter, in inflationary

	theories of gravity. The gauge-invariant theory of classical and

	It allows a simple derivation of the relation between temperature

	a semiclassical nature. According to this, the escape from the general

	needed to regularize the divergences which come from the expected
	value. These counterterms are responsible for a higher derivative
	metric gravitation. Starobinsky's idea was that these higher derivatives

	are considered for general Bianchi I anisotropic space-times in this
	higher derivative theory. The approach is ``experimental'' in the
	sense that there is no attempt for an analytical investigation of
	the results. It is shown that for zero cosmological constant Lambda=0,
	there are sets of initial conditions which form basins of attraction
	that asymptote Minkowski space. The complement of this set of initial
	conditions form basins which are attracted to some singular solutions.
	It is also shown, for a cosmological constant Lambda>0, that there
	are basins of attraction to a specific de Sitter solution. This result
	is consistent with Starobinsky's initial idea. The complement of
	this set also forms basins that are attracted to some type of singular

  year = {2008},
  volume = {462},
  pages = {67-121},
  month = {6},
  abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing is responsible for the shearing and magnification
	of the images of high-redshift sources due to the presence of intervening
	matter. The distortions are due to fluctuations in the gravitational
	potential, and are directly related to the distribution of matter
	and to the geometry and dynamics of the Universe. As a consequence,
	weak gravitational lensing offers unique possibilities for probing
	the Dark Matter and Dark Energy in the Universe. In this review,
	we summarise the theoretical and observational state of the subject,
	focussing on the statistical aspects of weak lensing, and consider
	the prospects for weak lensing surveys in the future. Weak gravitational
	lensing surveys are complementary to both galaxy surveys and cosmic
	microwave background (CMB) observations as they probe the unbiased
	non-linear matter power spectrum at modest redshifts. Most of the
	cosmological parameters are accurately estimated from CMB and large-scale
	galaxy surveys, so the focus of attention is shifting to understanding
	the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. On the theoretical side,
	recent advances in the use of 3D information of the sources from
	photometric redshifts promise greater statistical power, and these
	are further enhanced by the use of statistics beyond two-point quantities
	such as the power spectrum. The use of 3D information also alleviates
	difficulties arising from physical effects such as the intrinsic
	alignment of galaxies, which can mimic weak lensing to some extent.
	On the observational side, in the next few years weak lensing surveys
	such as CFHTLS, VST-KIDS and Pan-STARRS, and the planned Dark Energy
	Survey, will provide the first weak lensing surveys covering very
	large sky areas and depth. In the long run even more ambitious programmes
	such as DUNE, the Supernova Anisotropy Probe (SNAP) and Large-aperture
	Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) are planned. Weak lensing of diffuse
	components such as the CMB and 21 cm emission can also provide valuable
	cosmological information. Finally, we consider the prospects for
	joint analysis with other probes, such as (1) the CMB to probe background
	cosmology (2) galaxy surveys to probe large-scale bias and (3) Sunyaev
	Zeldovich surveys to study small-scale baryonic physics, and consider
	the lensing effect on cosmological supernova observations.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos
	in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from
	simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated
	individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging
	from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters.
	The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be
	fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal"
	profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently
	its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that
	reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo
	profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii
	but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper
	than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves
	of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically
	with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies
	depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities
	significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain
	why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples
	of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters,
	our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs
	and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they
	suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster
	core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight
	two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated
	to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars,
	and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed
	abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core
	structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process,
	and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or
	remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

  abstract = {We present a test of different error estimators for two-point clustering
	statistics, appropriate for present and future large galaxy redshift
	surveys. Using an ensemble of very large dark matter CDM N-body simulations,
	we compare internal error estimators (jackknife and bootstrap) to
	external ones (Monte Carlo realizations). For three-dimensional clustering
	statistics, we find that none of the internal error methods investigated
	is able to reproduce either accurately or robustly the errors of
	external estimators on 1 to 25h-1Mpc scales. The standard bootstrap
	overestimates the variance of (s) by ~40 per cent on all scales probed,
	but recovers, in a robust fashion, the principal eigenvectors of
	the underlying covariance matrix. The jackknife returns the correct
	variance on large scales, but significantly overestimates it on smaller
	scales. This scale dependence in the jackknife affects the recovered
	eigenvectors, which tend to disagree on small scales with the external
	estimates. Our results have important implications for fitting models
	to galaxy clustering measurements. For example, in a two-parameter
	fit to the projected correlation function, we find that the standard
	bootstrap systematically overestimates the 95 per cent confidence
	interval, while the jackknife method remains biased, but to a lesser
	extent. Ignoring the systematic bias, the scatter between realizations,
	for Gaussian statistics, implies that a 2 confidence interval, as
	inferred from an internal estimator, corresponds in practice to anything
	from 1 to 3. By oversampling the subvolumes, we find that it is possible,
	at least for the cases we consider, to obtain robust bootstrap variances
	and confidence intervals that agree with external error estimates.
	Our results are applicable to two-point statistics, like (s) and
	wp(rp), measured in large redshift surveys, and show that the interpretation
	of clustering measurements with internally estimated errors should
	be treated with caution.},

  abstract = {Context. The Planck satellite was launched in 2009 by the European
	Space Agency to study the properties of the cosmic microwave background
	(CMB). An expected result of the Planck data analysis is the distinction
	of the various contaminants of the CMB signal. Among these contaminants
	is the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, which is caused by the inverse
	Compton scattering of CMB photons by high energy electrons in the
	intracluster medium of galaxy clusters. Aims: We modify a public
	version of the JADE (Joint Approximate Diagonalization of Eigenmatrices)
	algorithm, to deal with noisy data, and then use this algorithm as
	a tool to search for SZ clusters in two simulated datasets. Methods:
	The first dataset is composed of simple "homemade" simulations and
	the second of full sky simulations of high angular resolution, available
	at the LAMBDA (Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis)
	website. The process of component separation can be summarized in
	four main steps: (1) pre-processing based on wavelet analysis, which
	performs an initial cleaning (denoising) of data to minimize the
	noise level; (2) the separation of the components (emissions) by
	JADE; (3) the calibration of the recovered SZ map; and (4) the identification
	of the positions and intensities of the clusters using the SExtractor
	software. Results: The results show that our JADE-based algorithm
	is effective in identifying the position and intensity of the SZ
	clusters, with the purities being higher then 90% for the extracted
	"catalogues". This value changes slightly according to the characteristics
	of noise and the number of components included in the input maps.
	Conclusions: The main highlight of our developed work is the effective
	recovery rate of SZ sources from noisy data, with no a priori assumptions.
	This powerful algorithm can be easily implemented and become an interesting
	complementary option to the "matched filter" algorithm (hereafter
	MF) widely used in SZ data analysis.},

  abstract = {A nonsingular cosmological scenario is presented in which the currently

	primordial Weylian "stiff matter" phase driven by a geometrized inflaton-like
	field. In the particular case of a Friedman-Robertson-Walker line
	element, it is shown that an unstable original Minkowski vacuum starts
	to collapse adiabatically at a remote past and bounces when a minimum
	radius is attained. Throughout the collapsing stage, this matter-free
	Universe is accelerated (or "inflationary"). As in models of spontaneous
	quantum creation, the bouncing phase can be shown to correspond to
	the propagation of a Weyl instanton in an Euclideanized, classically
	forbidden region. In the course of the bouncing period, concurrent
	to the maximal deviation of the Riemannian configuration, a geometry-driven
	amplification mechanism operates causing the exponential increase
	of entropy and matter fluctuations. Once the environment temperature
	is always bounded, this nonadiabatical process stands for a "Big
	-- but finite -- Bang" creation event, followed by a standard radiation-dominated
	era. The model describes an eternal, Friedman-like open Universe,

	coupled scalar in a locally de Sitter geometry of arbitrary spacetime
	dimension. We then employ it to compute the fully renormalized stress
	tensor at one and two loop orders for a massless, minimally coupled
	phi^4 theory which is released in Bunch-Davies vacuum at t=0 in co-moving
	coordinates. In this system the uncertainty principle elevates the
	scalar above the minimum of its potential, resulting in a phase of
	super-acceleration. With the non-derivative self-interaction the
	scalar's breaking of de Sitter invariance becomes observable. It
	is also worth noting that the weak energy condition is violated on
	cosmological scales. An interesting subsidiary result is that canceling
	overlapping divergences in the stress tensor requires a conformal
	counterterm which has no effect on purely scalar diagrams.},

  abstract = {Recent cosmological observations suggest the existence of a positive
	cosmological constant $\Lambda$ with the magnitude $\Lambda(G\hbar/c^3)
	\approx 10^{-123}$. This review discusses several aspects of the
	cosmological constant both from the cosmological (sections 1-6) and
	field theoretical (sections 7-11) perspectives. The first section
	introduces the key issues related to cosmological constant and provides
	a brief historical overview. This is followed by a summary of the
	kinematics and dynamics of the standard Friedmann model of the universe
	paying special attention to features involving the cosmological constant.
	Section 3 reviews the observational evidence for cosmological constant,
	especially the supernova results, constraints from the age of the
	universe and a few others. Theoretical models (quintessence, tachyonic
	scalar field, ...) with evolving cosmological `constant' are described
	from different perspectives in the next section. Constraints on dark
	energy from structure formation and from CMBR anisotropies are discussed
	in the next two sections. The latter part of the review (sections
	7-11) concentrates on more conceptual and fundamental aspects of
	the cosmological constant. Section 7 provides some alternative interpretations
	of the cosmological constant which could have a bearing on the possible
	solution to the problem. Several relaxation mechanisms have been
	suggested in the literature to reduce the cosmological constant to
	the currently observed value and some of these attempts are described
	in section 8. Next section gives a brief description of the geometrical
	structure of the de Sitter spacetime and the thermodynamics of the
	de Sitter universe is taken up in section 10. The last section deals
	with the role of string theory in the cosmological constant problem.},

  abstract = {Physics invites the idea that space contains energy whose gravitational
	effect approximates that of Einstein's cosmological constant, Lambda;
	nowadays the concept is termed dark energy or quintessence. Physics
	also suggests the dark energy could be dynamical, allowing the arguably
	appealing picture that the dark energy density is evolving to its
	natural value, zero, and is small now because the expanding universe
	is old. This alleviates the classical problem of the curious energy
	scale of order a millielectronvolt associated with a constant Lambda.
	Dark energy may have been detected by recent advances in the cosmological
	tests. The tests establish a good scientific case for the context,
	in the relativistic Friedmann-Lemaitre model, including the gravitational
	inverse square law applied to the scales of cosmology. We have well-checked
	evidence that the mean mass density is not much more than one quarter
	of the critical Einstein-de Sitter value. The case for detection
	of dark energy is serious but not yet as convincing; we await more
	checks that may come out of work in progress. Planned observations
	might be capable of detecting evolution of the dark energy density;
	a positive result would be a considerable stimulus to attempts to
	understand the microphysics of dark energy. This review presents
	the basic physics and astronomy of the subject, reviews the history
	of ideas, assesses the state of the observational evidence, and comments
	on recent developments in the search for a fundamental theory.},

	Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) distance measurements from galaxy
	samples covering different redshift ranges, and apply this method
	to analyse samples drawn from the SDSS and 2dFGRS. BAO are detected
	in the clustering of the combined 2dFGRS and SDSS main galaxy samples,
	and measure the distance--redshift relation at z=0.2. BAO in the
	clustering of the SDSS luminous red galaxies measure the distance--redshift
	relation at z=0.35. The observed scale of the BAO calculated from
	these samples and from the combined sample are jointly analysed using
	estimates of the correlated errors, to constrain the form of the
	distance measure D_V(z)=[(1+z)^2D_A^2cz/H(z)]^(1/3). Here D_A is
	the angular diameter distance, and H(z) is the Hubble parameter.
	This gives r_s/D_V(0.2)=0.1980+/-0.0058 and r_s/D_V(0.35)=0.1094+/-0.0033
	(1sigma errors), with correlation coefficient of 0.39, where r_s
	is the comoving sound horizon scale at recombination. Matching the
	BAO to have the same measured scale at all redshifts then gives D_V(0.35)/D_V(0.2)=1.812+/-0.060.
	The recovered ratio is roughly consistent with that predicted by
	the higher redshift SNLS supernovae data for Lambda cosmologies,
	but does require slightly stronger cosmological acceleration at low
	redshift. If we force the cosmological model to be flat with constant
	w, then we find Om_m=0.249+/-0.018 and w=-1.004+/-0.089 after combining
	with the SNLS data, and including the WMAP measurement of the apparent

	Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the
	cosmological parameters. All SN peak magnitudes are standardized

	yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters
	that is approximated by the relation 0.8 Omega_M - 0.6 Omega_Lambda
	~= -0.2 +/- 0.1 in the region of interest (Omega_M <~ 1.5). For a

	also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological

	than the Planck length. In this scenario, one can find new ways to
	solve the standard cosmological puzzles. One can also obtain scale
	invariant spectra for both scalar and tensor perturbations: this
	will be the case, for instance, if the contracting Universe is dust-dominated
	at the time at which large wavelength perturbations get larger than
	the curvature scale. We present a particular example based on a dust
	fluid classically contracting model, where a bounce occurs due to
	quantum effects, in which these features are explicit.},

	an observationally well tested cluster selection function. Special

	We quantitatively investigate the respective impact of the cluster

	in the Quintom theory NEC can be satisfied. We take three examples

  abstract = {We present and employ a new kinematical approach to cosmological `dark
	energy' studies. We construct models in terms of the dimensionless
	second and third derivatives of the scale factor a(t) with respect
	to cosmic time t, namely the present-day value of the deceleration
	parameter q_0 and the cosmic jerk parameter, j(t). An elegant feature
	of this parameterization is that all LCDM models have j(t)=1 (constant),
	which facilitates simple tests for departures from the LCDM paradigm.
	Applying our model to the three best available sets of redshift-independent
	distance measurements, from type Ia supernovae and X-ray cluster
	gas mass fraction measurements, we obtain clear statistical evidence
	for a late time transition from a decelerating to an accelerating
	phase. For a flat model with constant jerk, j(t)=j, we measure q_0=-0.81+-0.14
	and j=2.16+0.81-0.75, results that are consistent with LCDM at about
	the 1sigma confidence level. A standard `dynamical' analysis of the
	same data, employing the Friedmann equations and modeling the dark
	energy as a fluid with an equation of state parameter, w (constant),
	gives Omega_m=0.306+0.042-0.040 and w=-1.15+0.14-0.18, also consistent
	with LCDM at about the 1sigma level. In comparison to dynamical analyses,
	the kinematical approach uses a different model set and employs a
	minimum of prior information, being independent of any particular
	gravity theory. The results obtained with this new approach therefore
	provide important additional information and we argue that both kinematical
	and dynamical techniques should be employed in future dark energy
	studies, where possible. Our results provide further interesting
	support for the concordance LCDM paradigm.},

	instabilities and oscillations in the matter power spectrum, can
	be avoided if a specific type of intrinsic entropy perturbation is

  abstract = {We present a new determination of the cluster mass function and velocity
	dispersion function in a volume $\sim10^7 h^3$Mpc$^{-3}$ using the
	Fourth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We use
	the caustic technique to remove foreground and background galaxies.
	The cluster virial mass function agrees well with recent estimates
	from both X-ray observations and cluster richnesses. The mass function
	lies between those predicted by the First-Year and Three-Year WMAP
	data. We constrain the cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$
	and find good agreement with WMAP and constraints from other techniques.
	With the CIRS mass function alone, we estimate $\Omega_m=0.24^{+0.14}_{-0.09}$
	and $\sigma_8=0.92^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$, or $\sigma_8=0.84\pm$0.03 when
	holding $\Omega_m=0.3$ fixed. We also use the WMAP parameters as
	priors and constrain velocity segregation in clusters. Using the
	First and Third-Year results, we infer velocity segregation of $\sigma_{gxy}/\sigma_DM\approx0.94\pm$0.05
	or 1.28$\pm$0.06 respectively. We compare the velocity dispersion
	function of clusters to that of early-type galaxies and conclude
	that clusters comprise the high-velocity end of the velocity dispersion
	function of dark matter haloes. The evolution of cluster abundances
	provides constraints on dark energy models; the mass function presented
	here offers an important low redshift calibration benchmark.},

  abstract = {We present a refined treatment of H, He I, and He II recombination
	in the early universe. The difference from previous calculations
	is that we use multilevel atoms and evolve the population of each
	level with redshift by including all bound-bound and bound-free transitions.
	In this framework we follow several hundred atomic energy levels
	for H, He I, and He II combined. The main improvements of this method
	over previous recombination calculations are (1) allowing excited
	atomic level populations to depart from an equilibrium distribution,
	(2) replacing the total recombination coefficient with recombination
	to and photoionization from each level calculated directly at each
	redshift step, and (3) correct treatment of the He I atom, including
	the triplet and singlet states. We find that xe(=ne/nH) is approximately
	10% smaller at redshifts <~800 than in previous calculations, as
	a result of the nonequilibrium of the excited states of H that is
	caused by the strong but cool radiation field at those redshifts.
	In addition, we find that He I recombination is delayed compared
	with previous calculations and occurs only just before H recombination.
	These changes in turn can affect the predicted power spectrum of
	microwave anisotropies at the few percent level. Other improvements,
	such as including molecular and ionic species of H, including complete
	heating and cooling terms for the evolution of the matter temperature,
	including collisional rates, and including feedback of the secondary
	spectral distortions on the radiation field, produce negligible change
	to the ionization fraction. The lower xe at low z found in this work
	affects the abundances of H molecular and ionic species by 10%-25%.
	However, this difference is probably not larger than other uncertainties
	in the reaction rates.},

	of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich-selected (SZ-selected) galaxy clusters detected
	in a millimeter-wave survey by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The
	cluster sample used in this analysis consists of nine optically confirmed
	high-mass clusters comprising the high-significance end of the total
	cluster sample identified in 455 deg2 of sky surveyed during 2008
	at 148 GHz. We focus on the most massive systems to reduce the degeneracy
	between unknown cluster astrophysics and cosmology derived from SZ
	surveys. We describe the scaling relation between cluster mass and
	SZ signal with a four-parameter fit. Marginalizing over the values
	of the parameters in this fit with conservative priors gives 8 =
	0.851 0.115 and w = -1.14 0.35 for a spatially flat wCDM cosmological
	model with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) seven-year
	priors on cosmological parameters. This gives a modest improvement
	in statistical uncertainty over WMAP seven-year constraints alone.
	Fixing the scaling relation between the cluster mass and SZ signal
	to a fiducial relation obtained from numerical simulations and calibrated
	by X-ray observations, we find 8 = 0.821 0.044 and w = -1.05 0.20.
	These results are consistent with constraints from WMAP7 plus baryon
	acoustic oscillations plus Type Ia supernova which give 8 = 0.802
	0.038 and w = -0.98 0.053. A stacking analysis of the clusters in
	this sample compared to clusters simulated assuming the fiducial
	model also shows good agreement. These results suggest that, given
	the sample of clusters used here, both the astrophysics of massive
	clusters and the cosmological parameters derived from them are broadly
	consistent with current models.},

	selected cluster sample, known as MaxBCG, includes ~130,000 objects
	between redshift 0.1 and 0.3, ranging in size from small groups to
	massive clusters. We split the clusters into bins of richness and
	luminosity and stack the surface density contrast to produce mean
	radial profiles. The mean profiles are detected over a range of scales,
	from the inner halo (25 kpc/h) well into the surrounding large scale
	structure (30 Mpc/h), with a significance of 15 to 20 in each bin.
	The signal over this large range of scales is best interpreted in
	terms of the cluster-mass cross-correlation function. We pay careful
	attention to sources of systematic error, correcting for them where
	possible. The resulting signals are calibrated to the ~10\% level,
	with the dominant remaining uncertainty being the redshift distribution
	of the background sources. We find that the profiles scale strongly
	with richness and luminosity. We find the signal within a given richness
	bin depends upon luminosity, suggesting that luminosity is more closely
	correlated with mass than galaxy counts. We split the samples by
	redshift but detect no significant evolution. The profiles are not
	well described by power laws. In a subsequent series of papers we
	invert the profiles to three-dimensional mass profiles, show that
	they are well fit by a halo model description, measure mass-to-light
	ratios and provide a cosmological interpretation.},

	We show how the shape of the dark energy potential can be recovered
	non parametrically using this formalism and we present approximations
	analogous to the ones relevant to slow-roll inflation. Since presently
	available data do not allow a non-parametric and exact reconstruction
	of the potential, we consider a general parametric description. This
	reconstruction can also be used in other approaches followed in the
	literature (e.g., the reconstruction of the redshift evolution of
	the dark energy equation of state w(z)). Using observations of passively
	evolving galaxies and supernova data we derive constraints on the
	dark energy potential shape in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.8.
	Our findings show that at the 1sigma level the potential is consistent

	We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat Lambda-dominated
	universe seeded by nearly scale-invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations,
	fits the WMAP data. With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can
	fit finer scale CMB measurements and measurements of large scle structure
	(galaxy surveys and the Lyman alpha forest). This simple model is
	also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements. We
	then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with
	other finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), 2dFGRS measurements
	and Lyman alpha forest data to find the model's best fit cosmological
	parameters: h=0.71+0.04-0.03, Omega_b h^2=0.0224+-0.0009, Omega_m
	h^2=0.135+0.008-0.009, tau=0.17+-0.06, n_s(0.05/Mpc)=0.93+-0.03,

	arises directly from the TE data and not from this model fit, but
	they are consistent. These parameters imply that the age of the universe
	is 13.7+-0.2 Gyr. The data favors but does not require a slowly varying
	spectral index. By combining WMAP data with other astronomical data
	sets, we constrain the geometry of the universe, Omega_tot = 1.02

	confidence limit assuming w >= -1), and the energy density in stable
	neutrinos, Omega_nu h^2 < 0.0076 (95\% confidence limit). For 3 degenerate

  abstract = {Primordial nucleosynthesis probes the Universe during its early evolution.
	Given the progress in exploring the constituents, structure, and
	recent evolution of the Universe, it is timely to review the status
	of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and confront its predictions, and
	the constraints that emerge from them, with those derived from independent
	observations of the Universe at much later epochs. Following an overview
	of the key physics that controls the synthesis of the elements in
	the early Universe, the predictions of BBN in the standard (and some
	nonstandard) models of cosmology and particle physics are presented.
	The observational data used to infer the primordial abundances are
	described, with an emphasis on the distinction between precision
	and accuracy. These are compared with the predictions, testing the
	internal consistency of BBN and enabling a comparison of the BBN-inferred
	constraints with those derived from the cosmic microwave background
	radiation and large scale structure data.},

	important source of information about the geometry and contents of
	the Universe. Even so, only a small fraction of the information available
	in the CMB has been extracted to date. Planck, the third space CMB
	mission after COBE and WMAP, is designed to extract essentially all
	of the information in the CMB temperature anisotropies. Planck will
	also measure to high accuracy the polarization of CMB anisotropies,
	which encodes not only a wealth of cosmological information but also
	provides a unique probe of the thermal history of the Universe during
	the time when the first stars and galaxies formed. Polarization measurements
	may also detect the signature of a stochastic background of gravitational
	waves generated during inflation, 10^(-35) s after the Big Bang.
	This book describes the expected scientific output of the Planck
	mission, both cosmological and non-cosmological. Chapter 1 summarizes
	the experimental concept and the operation of the satellite. Chapter
	2 covers the core cosmological science of the mission, describing
	the measurements that Planck will make, what we expect to learn from
	them about the geometry and contents of the Universe and about fundamental
	physics, and the combination of CMB data with other data to provide
	additional insights. Although the primary goal of Planck is cosmology,
	it will survey the whole sky with an unprecedented combination of
	frequency coverage, angular resolution, and sensitivity, providing
	data valuable for a broad range of astrophysics. Chapters 3, 4, and

	supernovae in the redshift interval z=0.3-1.2. These independent
	observations, confirm the result of Riess et al. (1998a) and Perlmutter
	et al. (1999) that supernova luminosity distances imply an accelerating
	universe. More importantly, they extend the redshift range of consistently
	observed SN Ia to z~1, where the signature of cosmological effects
	has the opposite sign of some plausible systematic effects. Consequently,
	these measurements not only provide another quantitative confirmation
	of the importance of dark energy, but also constitute a powerful
	qualitative test for the cosmological origin of cosmic acceleration.
	We find a rate for SN Ia of 1.4+/-0.5E-04 h^3/Mpc^3/yr at a mean
	redshift of 0.5. We present distances and host extinctions for 230
	SN Ia. These place the following constraints on cosmological quantities:
	if the equation of state parameter of the dark energy is w=-1, then
	H0 t0 = 0.96+/-0.04, and O_l - 1.4 O_m = 0.35+/-0.14. Including the
	constraint of a flat Universe, we find O_m = 0.28+/-0.05, independent
	of any large-scale structure measurements. Adopting a prior based
	on the 2dF redshift survey constraint on O_m and assuming a flat
	universe, we find that the equation of state parameter of the dark
	energy lies in the range -1.48<w<-0.72 at 95\% confidence. If we
	further assume that w>-1, we obtain w<-0.73 at 95\% confidence. These
	constraints are similar in precision and in value to recent results
	reported using the WMAP satellite, also in combination with the 2dF
	redshift survey.},

  abstract = {Multi-connected universe models with space identification scales smaller
	than the size of the observable universe produce topological images
	of cosmic sources. We generalise to locally hyperbolic spaces the
	crystallographic method, aimed to detect the topology from three-dimensional
	catalogs of cosmological objects. Our new method is based on the
	construction of a {\it collecting-correlated-pair} technique which
	enhances the topological signature and can make it detectable. The
	main idea is that in multi-connected universes, equal distances occur
	more often than by chance. We present an idealised version of this
	method as well as numerical simulations, we discuss the statistical
	relevance of the expected signature and we show how the extraction
	of a topological signal may also lead to a precise determination
	of the cosmological parameters. A more realistic version of the method
	which takes account of uncertainties in the position and velocity
	data is then discussed. We apply our technique to presently available
	data, namely a quasar catalog, and discuss the significance of the
	result. We show how the improved crystallographic method both competes
	with the two--dimensional methods based on cosmic microwave background
	analyses, and suffers from the same drawback: the shortage of present

	so that direct hydrostatic mass estimates are possible to nearly

	radii; its profile is not described well by a beta-model, showing
	continuous steepening with radius. The derived rho_tot profiles and
	their scaling with mass generally follow the Navarro-Frenk-White
	model with concentration expected for dark matter halos in LambdaCDM
	cosmology. In the inner region (r<0.1r_500), the gas density and
	temperature profiles exhibit significant scatter and trends with

	behavior, M_500 ~ T^alpha, where alpha=(1.5-1.6)+-0.1, if the gas
	temperatures are measured excluding the central cool cores. The normalization
	of this M-T relation is significantly, by =~ 30\%, higher than most
	previous X-ray determinations. We derive accurate gas mass fraction
	profiles, which show increase both with radius and cluster mass.
	The enclosed f_gas profiles within r_2500 =~ 0.4 r_500 have not yet
	reached any asymptotic value and are still far (by a factor of 1.5-2)

	a(t). In contrast, a retrodictive approach might usefully take observational
	dataconcerning the scale factor, and use the Friedmann equations
	to infer an observed cosmological equation of state. In particular,
	the value and derivatives of the scale factor determined at the current
	epoch place constraints on the value and derivatives of the cosmological
	equation of state at the current epoch. Determining the first three
	Taylor coefficients of the equation of state at the current epoch
	requires a measurement of the deceleration, jerk, and snap -- the
	second, third, and fourth derivatives of the scale factor with respect
	to time. Higher-order Taylor coefficients in the equation of state
	are related to higher-order time derivatives of the scale factor.
	Since the jerk and snap are rather difficult to measure, being related
	to the third and fourth terms in the Taylor series expansion of the
	Hubble law, it becomes clear why direct observational constraints
	on the cosmological equation of state are so relatively weak; and
	are likely to remain weak for the foreseeable future.},

  abstract = {It has been shown that a contracting universe with a dust-like ($w
	\approx 0$) fluid may provide an almost scale invariant spectrum
	for the gravitational scalar perturbations. As the universe contracts,
	the amplitude of such perturbations are amplified. The gauge invariant
	variable $\Phi$ develops a growing mode which becomes much larger
	than the constant one around the bounce phase. The constant mode
	has its amplitude fixed by Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) normalization,
	thus the amplitude of the growing mode can become much larger than
	1. In this paper, we first show that this is a general feature of
	bouncing models, since we expect that general relativity should be
	valid in all scales away from the bounce. However, in the Newtonian
	gauge, the variable $\Phi$ gives the value of the metric perturbation
	$\phi$, raising doubts on the validity of the linear perturbative
	regime at the bounce. In order to address this issue, we obtain a
	set of necessary conditions for the perturbative series to be valid
	along the whole history of the model, and we show that there is a
	gauge in which all these conditions are satisfied, for a set of models,
	if the constant mode is fixed by COBE normalization. As a by-product
	of this analysis, we point out that there are sets of solutions for
	the perturbation variables where some gauge-fixing conditions are
	not well defined, turning these gauges prohibited for those solutions.},

  year = {2005},
  volume = {77},
  pages = {207--258},
  abstract = {The most successful cosmological models to date envision structure
	formation as a hierarchical process in which gravity is constantly
	drawing lumps of matter together to form increasingly larger structures.
	Clusters of galaxies currently sit atop this hierarchy as the largest
	objects that have had time to collapse under the influence of their
	own gravity. Thus, their appearance on the cosmic scene is also relatively
	recent. Two features of clusters make them uniquely useful tracers
	of cosmic evolution. First, clusters are the biggest things whose
	masses we can reliably measure because they are the largest objects
	to have undergone gravitational relaxation and entered into virial
	equilibrium. Mass measurements of nearby clusters can therefore be
	used to determine the amount of structure in the universe on scales
	of 10^14 to 10^15 solar masses, and comparisons of the present-day
	cluster mass distribution with the mass distribution at earlier times
	can be used to measure the rate of structure formation, placing important
	constraints on cosmological models. Second, clusters are essentially
	``closed boxes'' that retain all their gaseous matter, despite the
	enormous energy input associated with supernovae and active galactic
	nuclei, because the gravitational potential wells of clusters are
	so deep. The baryonic component of clusters therefore contains a
	wealth of information about the processes associated with galaxy
	formation, including the efficiency with which baryons are converted
	into stars and the effects of the resulting feedback processes on
	galaxy formation. This article reviews our theoretical understanding
	of both the dark-matter component and the baryonic component of clusters.

  year = {2003},
  volume = {20},
  pages = {1529-1542},
  abstract = {When the density parameter is close to unity, the universe has a large
	curvature radius independently of its being hyperbolic, flat, or
	spherical. Whatever the curvature, the universe may have either a
	simply connected or a multiply connected topology. In the flat case,
	the topology scale is arbitrary, and there is no a priori reason
	for this scale to be of the same order as the size of the observable
	universe. In the hyperbolic case any nontrivial topology would almost
	surely be on a length scale too large to detect. In the spherical
	case, by contrast, the topology could easily occur on a detectable
	scale. The present paper shows how, in the spherical case, the assumption
	of a nearly flat universe simplifies the algorithms for detecting
	a multiply connected topology, but also reduces the amount of topology
	that can be seen. This is of primary importance for the upcoming
	cosmic microwave background data analysis. This article shows that
	for spherical spaces one may restrict the search to diametrically
	opposite pairs of circles in the circles-in-the-sky method and still
	detect the cyclic factor in the standard factorization of the holonomy
	group. This vastly decreases the algorithm's run time. If the search
	is widened to include pairs of candidate circles whose centers are
	almost opposite and whose relative twist varies slightly, then the
	cyclic factor along with a cyclic subgroup of the general factor
	may also be detected. Unfortunately the full holonomy group is, in
	general, unobservable in a nearly flat spherical universe, and so
	a full 6-parameter search is unnecessary. Crystallographic methods
	could also potentially detect the cyclic factor and a cyclic subgroup
	of the general factor, but nothing else.},

	normalization. This represents the first full numerical evolution
	of density perturbations and anisotropies in a spherical geometry.
	We extend the likelihood function versus from the COBE 2 year data
	to > 1. For large the presence of a very steep rise in the spectrum
	toward low t' allows us to put an upper limit of < 1.5 (95% CL) for
	primordial spectra with n < 1. This compares favorably with existing
	limits on . We show that there are a range of closed models that
	are consistent with observational constraints while being even older
	than the currently popular flat models with a cosmological constant.
	Future constraints from degree scale CMB data may soon probe this
	region of parameter space. A derivation of the perturbed Einstein,
	fluid, and Boltzmann equations for open and closed geometries is
	presented in an Appendix.},

	survey like the Dark Energy Survey, the accuracy required on the
	predicted halo mass function to make it an insignificant source of
	error on dark energy parameters is ~ 1\%. The analogous requirement
	on the predicted halo bias is less stringent (~ 5\%), particularly
	if the observable-mass distribution can be well constrained by other
	means. These requirements depend upon survey area but are relatively
	insensitive to survey depth. The most stringent requirements are
	likely to come from a survey over a significant fraction of the sky
	that aims to observe clusters down to relatively low mass, Mth ~
	10^13.7 Msun/h; for such a survey, the mass function and halo bias
	must be predicted to accuracies of ~ 0.5\% and ~ 1\%, respectively.
	These accuracies represent a limit on the practical need to calibrate
	ever more accurate halo mass and bias functions. We find that improving
	predictions for the mass function in the low-redshift and low-mass
	regimes is the most effective way to improve dark energy constraints.},

	then apply the integral method in order to solve this equation, writing

	written using ultra-spherical Bessel functions, which depend on curvature.
	These cannot be precomputed, as for flat space. Instead, we solve
	their differential equation directly for selected values of the multipoles.
	The resulting computational time is comparable to the flat-space
	case, improving over previous methods by 2-3 orders of magnitude.
	This allows one to compute highly accurate CMB temperature and polarization
	spectra, matter transfer functions, and their CMB normalizations
	for any cosmological model, thereby avoiding the need to use the
	various inexact fitting formulae that exist in the literature.},
