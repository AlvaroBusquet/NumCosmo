  Abstract                 = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has validated and made publicly available its Second Data Release. This data release consists of 3324 deg2 of five-band (ugriz) imaging data with photometry for over 88 million unique objects, 367,360 spectra of galaxies, quasars, stars, and calibrating blank sky patches selected over 2627 deg2 of this area, and tables of measured parameters from these data. The imaging data reach a depth of r~22.2 (95% completeness limit for point sources) and are photometrically and astrometrically calibrated to 2% rms and 100 mas rms per coordinate, respectively. The imaging data have all been processed through a new version of the SDSS imaging pipeline, in which the most important improvement since the last data release is fixing an error in the model fits to each object. The result is that model magnitudes are now a good proxy for point-spread function magnitudes for point sources, and Petrosian magnitudes for extended sources. The spectroscopy extends from 3800 to 9200 Å at a resolution of 2000. The spectroscopic software now repairs a systematic error in the radial velocities of certain types of stars and has substantially improved spectrophotometry. All data included in the SDSS Early Data Release and First Data Release are reprocessed with the improved pipelines and included in the Second Data Release. Further characteristics of the data are described, as are the data products themselves and the tools for accessing them.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the \~2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120° long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe the Dark Energy Survey (DES), a proposed optical-near infrared survey of 5000 sq. deg of the South Galactic Cap to 24th magnitude in SDSS griz, that would use a new 3 sq. deg CCD camera to be mounted on the Blanco 4-m telescope at Cerro Telolo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). The survey data will allow us to measure the dark energy and dark matter densities and the dark energy equation of state through four independent methods: galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing tomography, galaxy angular clustering, and supernova distances. These methods are doubly complementary: they constrain different combinations of cosmological model parameters and are subject to different systematic errors. By deriving the four sets of measurements from the same data set with a common analysis framework, we will obtain important cross checks of the systematic errors and thereby make a substantial and robust advance in the precision of dark energy measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the Sixth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. With this data release, the imaging of the northern Galactic cap is now complete. The survey contains images and parameters of roughly 287 million objects over 9583 deg2, including scans over a large range of Galactic latitudes and longitudes. The survey also includes 1.27 million spectra of stars, galaxies, quasars, and blank sky (for sky subtraction) selected over 7425 deg2 . This release includes much more stellar spectroscopy than was available in previous data releases and also includes detailed estimates of stellar temperatures, gravities, and metallicities. The results of improved photometric calibration are now available, with uncertainties of roughly 1% in g, r, i, and z, and 2% in u, substantially better than the uncertainties in previous data releases. The spectra in this data release have improved wavelength and flux calibration, especially in the extreme blue and extreme red, leading to the qualitatively better determination of stellar types and radial velocities. The spectrophotometric fluxes are now tied to point-spread function magnitudes of stars rather than fiber magnitudes. This gives more robust results in the presence of seeing variations, but also implies a change in the spectrophotometric scale, which is now brighter by roughly 0.35 mag. Systematic errors in the velocity dispersions of galaxies have been fixed, and the results of two independent codes for determining spectral classifications and redshifts are made available. Additional spectral outputs are made available, including calibrated spectra from individual 15 minute exposures and the sky spectrum subtracted from each exposure. We also quantify a recently recognized underestimation of the brightnesses of galaxies of large angular extent due to poor sky subtraction; the bias can exceed 0.2 mag for galaxies brighter than r=14 mag.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the Fifth Data Release (DR5) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). DR5 includes all survey quality data taken through 2005 June and represents the completion of the SDSS-I project (whose successor, SDSS-II, will continue through mid-2008). It includes five-band photometric data for 217 million objects selected over 8000 deg2 and 1,048,960 spectra of galaxies, quasars, and stars selected from 5713 deg2 of that imaging data. These numbers represent a roughly 20% increment over those of the Fourth Data Release; all the data from previous data releases are included in the present release. In addition to ``standard'' SDSS observations, DR5 includes repeat scans of the southern equatorial stripe, imaging scans across M31 and the core of the Perseus Cluster of galaxies, and the first spectroscopic data from SEGUE, a survey to explore the kinematics and chemical evolution of the Galaxy. The catalog database incorporates several new features, including photometric redshifts of galaxies, tables of matched objects in overlap regions of the imaging survey, and tools that allow precise computations of survey geometry for statistical investigations.},

The data release includes five-band photometric data for 180 million objects selected over 6670 deg2 and 673,280 spectra of galaxies, quasars, and stars selected from 4783 deg2 of those imaging data using the standard SDSS target selection algorithms. These numbers represent a roughly 27% increment over those of the Third Data Release; all the data from previous data releases are included in the present release. The Fourth Data Release also includes an additional 131,840 spectra of objects selected using a variety of alternative algorithms, to address scientific issues ranging from the kinematics of stars in the Milky Way thick disk to populations of faint galaxies and quasars.},

  Abstract                 = {The Cosmic Microwave Background fluctuations provide a powerful probe of the dark ages of the universe through the imprint of the secondary anisotropies associated with the reionization of the universe and the growth of structure. We review the relation between the secondary anisotropies and the primary anisotropies that are directly generated by quantum fluctuations in the very early universe. The physics of secondary fluctuations is described, with emphasis on the ionization history and the evolution of structure. We discuss the different signatures arising from the secondary effects in terms of their induced temperature fluctuations, polarization and statistics. The secondary anisotropies are being actively pursued at present, and we review the future and current observational status.},

  Abstract                 = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) started a new phase in 2008 August, with new instrumentation and new surveys focused on Galactic structure and chemical evolution, measurements of the baryon oscillation feature in the clustering of galaxies and the quasar Lyalpha forest, and a radial velocity search for planets around ~8000 stars. This paper describes the first data release of SDSS-III (and the eighth counting from the beginning of the SDSS). The release includes five-band imaging of roughly 5200 deg2 in the southern Galactic cap, bringing the total footprint of the SDSS imaging to 14,555 deg2, or over a third of the Celestial Sphere. All the imaging data have been reprocessed with an improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent photometric recalibration and flat-field determination. This release also includes all data from the second phase of the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 stars at both high and low Galactic latitudes. All the more than half a million stellar spectra obtained with the SDSS spectrograph have been reprocessed through an improved stellar parameter pipeline, which has better determination of metallicity for high-metallicity stars.},

  Abstract                 = {We reconstruct the equation of state $w(z)$ of dark energy (DE) using a recently released data set containing 172 type Ia supernovae without assuming the prior $w(z) \geq -1$ (in contrast to previous studies). We find that dark energy evolves rapidly and metamorphoses from dust-like behaviour at high $z$ ($w \simeq 0$ at $z \sim 1$) to a strongly negative equation of state at present ($w \lleq -1$ at $z \simeq 0$). Dark energy metamorphosis appears to be a robust phenomenon which manifests for a large variety of SNe data samples provided one does not invoke the weak energy prior $\rho + p \geq 0$. Invoking this prior considerably weakens the rate of growth of $w(z)$. These results demonstrate that dark energy with an evolving equation of state provides a compelling alternative to a cosmological constant if data are analysed in a prior-free manner and the weak energy condition is not imposed by hand.},

A theoretical basis that describes clusters as massive, multicomponent, quasi-equilibrium systems is growing in its capability to interpret multiwavelength observations of expanding scope and sensitivity. We review current cosmological results, including contributions to fundamental physics, obtained from observations of galaxy clusters. These results are consistent with and complementary to those from other methods. We highlight several areas of opportunity for the next few years, and emphasize the need for accurate modeling of survey selection and sources of systematic error. Capitalizing on these opportunities will require a multiwavelength approach and the application of rigorous statistical frameworks, utilizing the combined strengths of observers, simulators, and theorists.},

In this work, we study the ability of a recently proposed theory with massive gravitons, the so-called Visser theory, to explain the measurements of luminosity distance from the Union2 compilation, the most recent Type-Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) data set, adopting the current ratio of the total density of nonrelativistic matter to the critical density (\Omega_m) as a free parameter. We also combine the SNe Ia data with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. We find that, for the allowed interval of values for \Omega_m, a model based on Visser's theory can produce an accelerated expansion period without any dark energy component, but the combined analysis (SNe Ia+BAO+CMB) shows that the model is disfavored when compared with the \Lambda CDM model.},

  Abstract                 = {Cosmological gravitational waves (GWs) are usually associated with the transverse traceless part of the metric perturbations in the context of the theory of cosmological perturbations. These modes are just the usual polarizations '+' and '×' which appear in the general relativity theory. However, in the majority of the alternative theories of gravity, GWs can present more than these two polarization states. In this context, the Newman-Penrose formalism is particularly suitable for evaluating the number of non-null GW modes. In the present work we intend to take into account these extra polarization states for cosmological GWs in alternative theories of gravity. As an application, we derive the dynamical equations for cosmological GWs for two specific theories, namely a general scalar-tensor theory which presents four polarization states and a massive bimetric theory which is in the most general case with six polarization states for GWs. However, the mathematical tool presented here is quite general, so it can be used to study cosmological perturbations in all metric theories of gravity.},

In the present work we use the Newman-Penrose formalism to characterize GWs in quadratic gravity and in a particular class of f(R) Lagrangians. We find that both quadratic gravity and the f(R) theory belong to the most general invariant class of GWs, i.e., they can present up to six independent polarizations of GWs. For a particular combination of the parameters, we find that quadratic gravity can present up to five polarizations states. On the other hand, if we use the Palatini approach for f(R) theories, GWs present only the usual two transverse-traceless polarizations such as in general relativity. Thus, we conclude that the observation of GWs can strongly constrain the suitable formalism for these theories.},

In his theory, a prior background metric is necessary to take in account the massive term. Although in the great part of the astrophysical studies the Minkowski metric is the best choice to the background metric, it is not possible to consider this metric in cosmology. In order to keep the Minkowski metric as background in this case, we suggest an interpretation of the energy momentum conservation in Visser's theory, which is in accordance with the equivalence principle and recovers naturally the special relativity in the absence of gravitational sources. Although we do not present a general proof of our hypothesis we show its validity in the simple case of a plane and dust-dominated universe, in which the ``massive term'' appears like an extra contribution for the energy density.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from the detections of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of galaxies from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our results come from the Data Release 11 (DR11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and covering approximately 8500 square degrees and the redshift range 0.2 < z < 0.7. We also compare these results with those from the publicly released DR9 and DR10 samples. Assuming a concordance Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model, the DR11 sample covers a volume of 13 Gpc3 and is the largest region of the Universe ever surveyed at this density. We measure the correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the BAO feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of over 7σ in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, rd, which has a value of rd,fid = 149.28 Mpc in our fiducial cosmology. We find DV = (1264 ± 25 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.32 and DV = (2056 ± 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.57. At 1.0 per cent, this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. Separating the clustering along and transverse to the line of sight yields measurements at z = 0.57 of DA = (1421 ± 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) and H = (96.8 ± 3.4 km s-1 Mpc-1)(rd,fid/rd). Our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement with previous BAO measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwave background data for a spatially flat CDM model with a cosmological constant.},

  Abstract                 = {We present measurements of galaxy clustering from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III). These use the Data Release 9 (DR9) CMASS sample, which contains 264 283 massive galaxies covering 3275 square degrees with an effective redshift z = 0.57 and redshift range 0.43 < z < 0.7. Assuming a concordance ΛCDM cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc3, and represents the largest sample of the Universe ever surveyed at this density, n¯≈3×10-4 h-3 Mpc 3. We measure the angle-averaged galaxy correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of 5σ in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Combining with the SDSS-II luminous red galaxy sample, the detection significance increases to 6.7σ. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance to z = 0.57 relative to the sound horizon DV/rs = 13.67 ± 0.22 at z = 0.57. Assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19 Mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds to a distance DV (z = 0.57) = 2094 ± 34 Mpc. At 1.7 per cent, this is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. We place this result alongside previous BAO measurements in a cosmological distance ladder and find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. We use these distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, finding continuing support for a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.},

  Abstract                 = {The Dark Energy Survey (DES) will use a new imaging camera on the Blanco 4-m telescope at CTIO to image 5000 square degrees of sky in the South Galactic Cap in four optical bands, and to carry out repeat imaging over a smaller area to identify and measure lightcurves of Type Ia supernovae. The main imaging area overlaps the planned Sunyaev-Zel'dovich survey of the South Pole Telescope. The idea behind DES is to use four distinct and largely independent methods to probe the properties of dark energy: baryon oscillations of the power spectrum, abundance and spatial distribution of clusters, weak gravitational lensing, and Type Ia supernovae. This white paper outlines, in broad terms, some of the theoretical issues associated with the first three of these probes (the issues for supernovae are mostly different in character), and with the general task of characterizing dark energy and distinguishing it from alternative explanations for cosmic acceleration. A companion white paper discusses the kind of numerical simulations and other theoretical tools that will be needed to address the these issues and to create mock catalogs that allow end-to-end tests of analysis procedures. Although we have been thinking about these problems in the specific context of DES, many of them are also relevant to other planned dark energy studies.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the regularity of cluster pressure profiles with REXCESS, a representative sample of 33 local (z < 0.2) clusters drawn from the REFLEX catalogue and observed with XMM-Newton. The sample spans a mass range of 1014 M&sun; < M500 < 1015 M&sun;, where M500 is the mass corresponding to a density contrast of 500. We derive an average profile from observations scaled by mass and redshift according to the standard self-similar model, and find that the dispersion about the mean is remarkably low, at less than 30 per cent beyond 0.2 R500, but increases towards the center. Deviations about the mean are related to both the mass and the thermo-dynamical state of the cluster. Morphologically disturbed systems have systematically shallower profiles while cooling core systems are more concentrated. The scaled profiles exhibit a residual mass dependence with a slope of ~0.12, consistent with that expected from the empirically-derived slope of the M500 - YX relation; however, the departure from standard scaling decreases with radius and is consistent with zero at R500. The scatter in the core and departure from self-similar mass scaling is smaller compared to that of the entropy profiles, showing that the pressure is the quantity least affected by dynamical history and non-gravitational physics. Comparison with scaled data from several state of the art numerical simulations shows good agreement outside the core. Combining the observational data in the radial range [0.03-1] R500 with simulation data in the radial range [1-4] R500, we derive a robust measure of the universal pressure profile, that, in an analytical form, defines the physical pressure profile of clusters as a function of mass and redshift up to the cluster "boundary". Using this profile and direct spherical integration of the observed pressure profiles, we estimate the integrated Compton parameter Y and investigate its scaling with M500 and LX, the soft band X-ray luminosity. We consider both the spherically integrated quantity, Ysph(R), proportional to the gas thermal energy, and the cylindrically integrated quantity, Ycyl(R)=YSZ DA2, which is directly related to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signal. From the low scatter of the observed Ysph(R500) - YX relation we show that variations in pressure profile shape do not introduce extra scatter into the Ysph(R500) - M500 relation as compared to that from the YX - M500 relation. The Ysph(R500) - M500 and Ysph(R500) - LX relations derived from the data are in excellent agreement with those expected from the universal profile. This profile is used to derive the expected YSZ - M500 and YSZ - LX relations for any aperture.},

These events were detected and their multi-color light-curves measured using the MegaPrime/MegaCam instrument at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), by repeatedly imaging four one-square degree fields in four bands. Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at the VLT, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and to measure their redshift. With this data set, we have built a Hubble diagram extending to z=1, with all distance measurements involving at least two bands. Systematic uncertainties are evaluated making use of the multi-band photometry obtained at CFHT. Cosmological fits to this first year SNLS Hubble diagram give the following results : Omega_M = 0.263 +/- 0.042(stat) +/- 0.032(sys) for a flat LambdaCDM model; and w = -1.023 +/- 0.090(stat) +/- 0.054(sys) for a flat cosmology with constant equation of state w when combined with the constraint from the recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations.},

  Abstract                 = {We derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energy models from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data. We take advantage of high-precision BAO measurements from galaxy clustering and the Ly-alpha forest (LyaF) in the BOSS survey of SDSS-III. BAO data alone yield a high confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the CMB angular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. Combining BAO and SN data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of $H_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/Mpc. This measurement assumes standard pre-recombination physics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature, so agreement with CMB-based estimates that assume a flat LCDM cosmology is an important corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. For open LCDM, our BAO+SN+CMB combination yields $\Omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature $\Omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. When we allow more general forms of evolving dark energy, the BAO+SN+CMB parameter constraints remain consistent with flat LCDM. While the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the LyaF BAO measurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions. Models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at high redshifts remain consistent with our constraints, but models where dark matter decays into radiation are sharply limited. Expansion history alone yields an upper limit of 0.56 eV on the summed mass of neutrino species, improving to 0.26 eV if we include Planck CMB lensing. Standard dark energy models constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that is high compared to most, but not all, observational estimates. (Abridged)},

  Abstract                 = {The first-year WMAP data taken at their face value hint that the Universe might be slightly positively curved and therefore necessarily finite, since all spherical (Clifford-Klein) space forms M^3 = S^3/Gamma, given by the quotient of S^3 by a group Gamma of covering transformations, possess this property. We examine the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) for all typical groups Gamma corresponding to homogeneous universes. The CMB angular power spectrum and the temperature correlation function are computed for the homogeneous spaces as a function of the total energy density parameter Omega_tot in the large range [1.01, 1.20] and are compared with the WMAP data. We find that out of the infinitely many homogeneous spaces only the three corresponding to the binary dihedral group T*, the binary octahedral group O*, and the binary icosahedral group I* are in agreement with the WMAP observations. Furthermore, if Omega_tot is restricted to the interval [1.00, 1.04], the space described by T* is excluded since it requires a value of Omega_tot which is probably too large being in the range [1.06, 1.07]. We thus conclude that there remain only the two homogeneous spherical spaces S^3/O* and S^3/I* with Omega_tot of about 1.038 and 1.018, respectively, as possible topologies for our Universe.},

  Abstract                 = {SPTpol is a dual-frequency polarization-sensitive camera that was deployed on the 10-meter South Pole Telescope in January 2012. SPTpol will measure the polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) on angular scales spanning an arcminute to several degrees. The polarization sensitivity of SPTpol will enable a detection of the CMB ``B-mode'' polarization from the detection of the gravitational lensing of the CMB by large scale structure, and a detection or improved upper limit on a primordial signal due to inationary gravity waves. The two measurements can be used to constrain the sum of the neutrino masses and the energy scale of ination. These science goals can be achieved through the polarization sensitivity of the SPTpol camera and careful control of systematics. The SPTpol camera consists of 768 pixels, each containing two transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers coupled to orthogonal polarizations, and a total of 1536 bolometers. The pixels are sensitive to light in one of two frequency bands centered at 90 and 150 GHz, with 180 pixels at 90 GHz and 588 pixels at 150 GHz. The SPTpol design has several features designed to control polarization systematics, including: singlemoded feedhorns with low cross-polarization, bolometer pairs well-matched to dfference atmospheric signals, an improved ground shield design based on far-sidelobe measurements of the SPT, and a small beam to reduce temperature to polarization leakage. We present an overview of the SPTpol instrument design, project status, and science projections.},

  Abstract                 = {We explore consistency among different distance measures, including Supernovae Type Ia data, measurements of the Hubble parameter, and determination of the Baryon acoustic oscillation scale. We present new constraints on the cosmic transparency combining H(z) data together with the latest Supernovae Type Ia data compilation. This combination, in the context of a flat ΛCDM model, improves current constraints by nearly an order of magnitude although the constraints presented here are parametric rather than non-parametric. We re-examine the recently reported tension between the Baryon acoustic oscillation scale and Supernovae data in light of possible deviations from transparency, concluding that the source of the discrepancy may most likely be found among systematic effects of the modelling of the low redshift data or a simple ~ 2-σ statistical fluke, rather than in exotic physics. Finally, we attempt to draw model-independent conclusions about the recent accelerated expansion, determining the acceleration redshift to be zacc = 0.35+0.20-0.13 (1-σ).},

  Abstract                 = {The halo mass function from N-body simulations of collisionless matter is generally used to retrieve cosmological parameters from observed counts of galaxy clusters. This neglects the observational fact that the baryonic mass fraction in clusters is a random variable that, on average, increases with the total mass (within an overdensity of 500). Considering a mock catalog that includes tens of thousands of galaxy clusters, as expected from the forthcoming generation of surveys, we show that the effect of a varying baryonic mass fraction will be observable with high statistical significance. The net effect is a change in the overall normalization of the cluster mass function and a milder modification of its shape. Our results indicate the necessity of taking into account baryonic corrections to the mass function if one wants to obtain unbiased estimates of the cosmological parameters from data of this quality. We introduce the formalism necessary to accomplish this goal. Our discussion is based on the conditional probability of finding a given value of the baryonic mass fraction for clusters of fixed total mass. Finally, we show that combining information from the cluster counts with measurements of the baryonic mass fraction in a small subsample of clusters (including only a few tens of objects) will nearly optimally constrain the cosmological parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the bias and scatter in mass measurements of galaxy clusters resulting from fitting a spherically symmetric Navarro, Frenk, & White model to the reduced tangential shear profile measured in weak-lensing (WL) observations. The reduced shear profiles are generated for ≈104 cluster-sized halos formed in a ΛCDM cosmological N-body simulation of a 1 h -1 Gpc box. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the scatter in the WL masses derived using this fitting method has irreducible contributions from the triaxial shapes of cluster-sized halos and uncorrelated large-scale matter projections along the line of sight. Additionally, we find that correlated large-scale structure within several virial radii of clusters contributes a smaller, but nevertheless significant, amount to the scatter. The intrinsic scatter due to these physical sources is ≈20% for massive clusters and can be as high as ≈30% for group-sized systems. For current, ground-based observations, however, the total scatter should be dominated by shape noise from the background galaxies used to measure the shear. Importantly, we find that WL mass measurements can have a small, ≈5%-10%, but non-negligible amount of bias. Given that WL measurements of cluster masses are a powerful way to calibrate cluster mass-observable relations for precision cosmological constraints, we strongly emphasize that a robust calibration of the bias requires detailed simulations that include more observational effects than we consider here. Such a calibration exercise needs to be carried out for each specific WL mass estimation method, as the details of the method determine in part the expected scatter and bias. We present an iterative method for estimating mass M 500c that can eliminate the bias for analyses of ground-based data.},

  Abstract                 = {The Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerated Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) is a narrow band, very wide field Cosmological Survey to be carried out from the Javalambre Observatory in Spain with a purpose-built, dedicated 2.5m telescope and a 4.7 sq.deg. camera with 1.2Gpix. Starting in late 2015, J-PAS will observe 8500sq.deg. of Northern Sky and measure $0.003(1+z)$ photo-z for $9\times10^7$ LRG and ELG galaxies plus several million QSOs, sampling an effective volume of $\sim 14$ Gpc$^3$ up to $z=1.3$ and becoming the first radial BAO experiment to reach Stage IV. J-PAS will detect $7\times 10^5$ galaxy clusters and groups, setting constrains on Dark Energy which rival those obtained from its BAO measurements. Thanks to the superb characteristics of the site (seeing ~0.7 arcsec), J-PAS is expected to obtain a deep, sub-arcsec image of the Northern sky, which combined with its unique photo-z precision will produce one of the most powerful cosmological lensing surveys before the arrival of Euclid. J-PAS unprecedented spectral time domain information will enable a self-contained SN survey that, without the need for external spectroscopic follow-up, will detect, classify and measure $\sigma_z\sim 0.5\%$ redshifts for $\sim 4000$ SNeIa and $\sim 900$ core-collapse SNe. The key to the J-PAS potential is its innovative approach: a contiguous system of 54 filters with $145\AA$ width, placed $100\AA$ apart over a multi-degree FoV is a powerful "redshift machine", with the survey speed of a 4000 multiplexing low resolution spectrograph, but many times cheaper and much faster to build. The J-PAS camera is equivalent to a 4.7 sq.deg. "IFU" and it will produce a time-resolved, 3D image of the Northern Sky with a very wide range of Astrophysical applications in Galaxy Evolution, the nearby Universe and the study of resolved stellar populations.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the final nine-year maps and basic results from the WMAP mission. We provide new nine-year full sky temperature maps that were processed to reduce the asymmetry of the effective beams. Temperature and polarization sky maps are examined to separate CMB anisotropy from foreground emission, and both types of signals are analyzed in detail. The WMAP mission has resulted in a highly constrained LCDM cosmological model with precise and accurate parameters in agreement with a host of other cosmological measurements. When WMAP data are combined with finer scale CMB, baryon acoustic oscillation, and Hubble constant measurements, we find that Big Bang nucleosynthesis is well supported and there is no compelling evidence for a non-standard number of neutrino species (3.26+/-0.35). The model fit also implies that the age of the universe is 13.772+/-0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H0 = 69.32+/-0.80 km/s/Mpc. Inflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with Gaussian random phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity reported earlier by WMAP now has high statistical significance (n_s = 0.9608+/-0.0080); and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean, Omega_k = -0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038). Overall, the WMAP mission has resulted in a reduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for the standard six-parameter LCDM model, based on CMB data alone. For a model including tensors, the allowed seven-parameter volume has been reduced by a factor 117,000. Other cosmological observations are in accord with the CMB predictions, and the combined data reduces the cosmological parameter volume even further. With no significant anomalies and an adequate goodness-of-fit, the inflationary flat LCDM model and its precise and accurate parameters rooted in WMAP data stands as the standard model of cosmology.},

  Abstract                 = {We study in this paper three different theories of gravitation with massive gravitons--the modified Fierz Pauli model, massive gravity and the bimetric theory proposed by Visser--in linear perturbation theory around a Minkowski and a flat Friedmann Robertson Walker background. For the transverse-traceless tensor perturbations we show that the three theories give rise to the same dynamical equations, to the same form of the tensor Sachs Wolfe effect, and consequently to the same form of the Boltzmann equations for the radiative transfer in general relativity. We then analyze vector perturbations in these theories and show that they do not give the same results as in the previous case. We first show that vector perturbations in massive gravity present the same form as found in general relativity, whereas in the modified Fierz Pauli theory the vector gravitational-wave polarization modes (Psi3 amplitudes in the Newman Penrose formalism) do not decay too fast as happens in the former case. Rather, we show that such Psi3 polarization modes give rise to an unusual vector Sachs Wolfe effect, leaving a signature in the quadrupole form Y2,+-1(theta, phiv) on the cosmic microwave background radiation polarization. We then derive the details for the Thomson scattering of CMB photons for these Psi3 modes, and then construct the correspondent Boltzmann equations. Based upon these results we then qualitatively show that Psi3-mode vector signatures--if they do exist--could clearly be distinguished on the CMB polarization from the usual Psi4 tensor modes. We also estimate that the graviton mass limit for the vector modes is m = 10-66 g 10-29 cm-1, so that vector modes with masses below this limit exhibit the same dynamical evolution as the massless gravitons. We argue at the end of this paper that CMB polarization experiments can be decisive to test alternative theories of gravitation by measuring CMB polarization in the E-mode.},

We first study the time evolution of the tensor modes in Massive Gravity and show that there is a graviton mass limit ml = 10-66g ~ 10-29cm-1, so that for masses m <= ml the tensor perturbations in Massive Gravity are indistinguishable from the corresponding ones in GR. Also, we show that short wavelength massive modes behave almost indistinguishably from their massless counterparts. Later on, we show that massive gravitons with masses within the range m = 10-27cm-1 - m = 10-26cm-1 would leave a clear signature on the lower multipoles (ell < 30) in the CMB anisotropy power spectrum. Hence, our results indicate that CMB anisotropies measurements might be decisive to show whether the tensor modes are massive or not.},

  Abstract                 = {The spectrum and amplitude of the stochastic background of relic gravitons produced in a bouncing universe is calculated. The matter content of the model consists of dust and radiation fluids, and the bounce occurs due to quantum cosmological effects when the universe approaches the classical singularity in the contracting phase. The resulting amplitude is very small and it cannot be observed by any present and near future gravitational wave detector. Hence, as in the ekpyrotic model, any observation of these relic gravitons will rule out this type of quantum cosmological bouncing model.},

  Abstract                 = { Aims: We present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observations obtained by the SDSS-II and SNLS collaborations. The dataset includes several low-redshift samples (z< 0.1), all three seasons from the SDSS-II (0.05 <z< 0.4), and three years from SNLS (0.2 <z< 1), and it totals 740 spectroscopically confirmed type Ia supernovae with high-quality light curves. Methods: We followed the methods and assumptions of the SNLS three-year data analysis except for the following important improvements: 1) the addition of the full SDSS-II spectroscopically-confirmed SN Ia sample in both the training of the SALT2 light-curve model and in the Hubble diagram analysis (374 SNe); 2) intercalibration of the SNLS and SDSS surveys and reduced systematic uncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect to the cosmology analysis; and 3) a thorough investigation of systematic errors associated with the SALT2 modeling of SN Ia light curves. Results: We produce recalibrated SN Ia light curves and associated distances for the SDSS-II and SNLS samples. The large SDSS-II sample provides an effective, independent, low-z anchor for the Hubble diagram and reduces the systematic error from calibration systematics in the low-z SN sample. For a flat ΛCDM cosmology, we find Ωm =0.295 ± 0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent with the most recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurement from the Planck and WMAP experiments. Our result is 1.8σ (stat+sys) different than the previously published result of SNLS three-year data. The change is due primarily to improvements in the SNLS photometric calibration. When combined with CMB constraints, we measure a constant dark-energy equation of state parameter w =-1.018 ± 0.057 (stat+sys) for a flat universe. Adding baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements gives similar constraints: w =-1.027 ± 0.055. Our supernova measurements provide the most stringent constraints to date on the nature of dark energy.

  Abstract                 = {We analyse the large-scale correlation function of the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) and detect a baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal at 105 h-1 Mpc. The 6dFGS BAO detection allows us to constrain the distance-redshift relation at zeff= 0.106. We achieve a distance measure of DV(zeff) = 457 ± 27 Mpc and a measurement of the distance ratio, rs(zd)/DV(zeff) = 0.336 ± 0.015 (4.5 per cent precision), where rs(zd) is the sound horizon at the drag epoch zd. The low-effective redshift of 6dFGS makes it a competitive and independent alternative to Cepheids and low-z supernovae in constraining the Hubble constant. We find a Hubble constant of H0= 67 ± 3.2 km s-1 Mpc-1 (4.8 per cent precision) that depends only on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe-7 (WMAP-7) calibration of the sound horizon and on the galaxy clustering in 6dFGS. Compared to earlier BAO studies at higher redshift, our analysis is less dependent on other cosmological parameters. The sensitivity to H0 can be used to break the degeneracy between the dark energy equation of state parameter w and H0 in the cosmic microwave background data. We determine that w=-0.97 ± 0.13, using only WMAP-7 and BAO data from both 6dFGS and Percival et al. (2010). We also discuss predictions for the large-scale correlation function of two future wide-angle surveys: the Wide field ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) blind H I survey (with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, ASKAP) and the proposed Transforming Astronomical Imaging surveys through Polychromatic Analysis of Nebulae (TAIPAN) all-southern-sky optical galaxy survey with the UK Schmidt Telescope. We find that both surveys are very likely to yield detections of the BAO peak, making WALLABY the first radio galaxy survey to do so. We also predict that TAIPAN has the potential to constrain the Hubble constant with 3 per cent precision.},

We find that DA(z) = (1205 ± 114, 1380 ± 95, 1534 ± 107) Mpc and H(z) = (82.6 ± 7.8, 87.9 ± 6.1, 97.3 ± 7.0) km s-1 Mpc-1 at these three redshifts. Further combining our results with other baryon acoustic oscillation and distant supernovae data sets, we use a Monte Carlo Markov Chain technique to determine the evolution of the Hubble parameter H(z) as a stepwise function in nine redshift bins of width Δz = 0.1, also marginalizing over the spatial curvature. Our measurements of H(z), which have precision better than 7 per cent in most redshift bins, are consistent with the expansion history predicted by a cosmological constant dark energy model, in which the expansion rate accelerates at redshift z < 0.7.},

We combine our correlation function with lower redshift measurements from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey, producing a stacked survey correlation function in which the statistical significance of the detection of the baryon acoustic peak is 4.9sigma relative to a zero-baryon model with no peak. We fit cosmological models to this combined baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data set comprising six distance-redshift data points, and compare the results with similar cosmological fits to the latest compilation of supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The BAO and SNe data sets produce consistent measurements of the equation-of-state w of dark energy, when separately combined with the CMB, providing a powerful check for systematic errors in either of these distance probes. Combining all data sets we determine w=-1.03 ± 0.08 for a flat universe, consistent with a cosmological constant model. Assuming dark energy is a cosmological constant and varying the spatial curvature, we find Omegak=-0.004 ± 0.006.},

  Abstract                 = {The usual interpretation of the quantum theory is self-consistent, but it involves an assumption that cannot be tested experimentally, viz., that the most complete possible specification of an individual system is in terms of a wave function that determines only probable results of actual measurement processes. The only way of investigating the truth of this assumption is by trying to find some other interpretation of the quantum theory in terms of at present "hidden" variables, which in principle determine the precise behavior of an individual system, but which are in practice averaged over in measurements of the types that can now be carried out. In this paper and in a subsequent paper, an interpretation of the quantum theory in terms of just such "hidden" variables is suggested. It is shown that as long as the mathematical theory retains its present general form, this suggested interpretation leads to precisely the same results for all physical processes as does the usual interpretation. Nevertheless, the suggested interpretation provides a broader conceptual framework than the usual interpretation, because it makes possible a precise and continuous description of all processes, even at the quantum level. This broader conceptual framework allows more general mathematical formulations of the theory than those allowed by the usual interpretation. Now, the usual mathematical formulation seems to lead to insoluble difficulties when it is extrapolated into the domain of distances of the order of 10-13 cm or less. It is therefore entirely possible that the interpretation suggested here may be needed for the resolution of these difficulties. In any case, the mere possibility of such an interpretation proves that it is not necessary for us to give up a precise, rational, and objective description of individual systems at a quantum level of accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we shall show how the theory of measurements is to be understood from the point of view of a physical interpretation of the quantum theory in terms of "hidden" variables, developed in a previous paper. We find that in principle, these "hidden" variables determine the precise results of each individual measurement process. In practice, however, in measurements that we now know how to carry out, the observing apparatus disturbs the observed system in an unpredictable and uncontrollable way, so that the uncertainty principle is obtained as a practical limitation on the possible precision of measurements. This limitation is not, however, inherent in the conceptual structure of our interpretation. We shall see, for example, that simultaneous measurements of position and momentum having unlimited precision would in principle be possible if, as suggested in the previous paper, the mathematical formulation of the quantum theory needs to be modified at very short distances in certain ways that are consistent with our interpretation but not with the usual interpretation. We give a simple explanation of the origin of quantum-mechanical correlations of distant objects in the hypothetical experiment of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, which was suggested by these authors as a criticism of the usual interpretation. Finally, we show that von Neumann's proof that quantum theory is not consistent with hidden variables does not apply to our interpretation, because the hidden variables contemplated here depend both on the state of the measuring apparatus and the observed system and therefore go beyond certain of von Neumann's assumptions. In two appendixes, we treat the problem of the electromagnetic field in our interpretation and answer certain additional objections which have arisen in the attempt to give a precise description for an individual system at the quantum level.},

Both features make finding a quantum theory difficult, yet it is important in the high-energy regime of the very early universe. This review article introduces some of the results for the quantum nature of space-time which indicate that there is a discrete, atomic picture not just for matter but also for space and time. At high energy scales, such deviations from the continuum affect the propagation of matter, the expansion of the universe, and perhaps even the form of symmetries such as Lorentz or CP transformations. All these effects may leave traces detectable by sensitive measurements, as pointed out here by examples.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new universal relation, satisfied by matter distributions at all observed scales, and show its amazingly good and detailed agreement with the predictions of the most up-to-date pure dark matter simulations of structure formation in the Universe. This work extends the previous analysis [0904.4054; 0909.5203] to a larger range of masses, demonstrates a different scaling law, and compares it with numerical simulations. This behaviour seems to be insensitive to the complicated feedback of baryons on dark matter. Therefore, it potentially allows to compare theoretical predictions directly with observations, thus providing a new tool to constrain the properties of dark matter. Such a universal property, observed in structures of all sizes (from dwarf spheroidal galaxies to galaxy clusters), is difficult to explain without dark matter, thus providing new evidence for its existence.},

  Abstract                 = {The inflationary scenario has become the paradigm of early universe cosmology, and - in conjuction with ideas from superstring theory - has led to speculations about an "inflationary multiverse". From a point of view of phenomenology, the inflationary universe scenario has been very successful. However, the scenario suffers from some conceptual problems, and thus it does not (yet) have the status of a solid theory. There are alternative ideas for the evolution of the very early universe which do not involve inflation but which agree with most current cosmological observations as well as inflation does. In this lecture I will outline the conceptual problems of inflation and introduce two alternative pictures - the "matter bounce" and "string gas cosmology", the latter being a realization of the "emergent universe" scenario based on some key principles of superstring theory. I will demonstrate that these two alternative pictures lead to the same predictions for the power spectrum of the observed large-scale structure and for the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave background anisotropies as the inflationary scenario, and I will mention predictions for future observations with which the three scenarios can be observationally teased apart.},

By matching cosmological fluctuations on a constant energy density hypersurface we show that the growing mode during the very slow collapsing pre-impact phase couples only to the decaying mode in the expanding post-impact phase, and that hence no scale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations is generated. Note that our conclusions may not apply to improved toy models for the Ekpyrotic scenario.},

To this end, we first consider covariantly defined quantities which are gauge-invariant in a perturbed Robertson-Walker universe: for these variables we derive a complete set of covariant linearized equations as they follow from the Bianchi and Ricci identities, and we show various possible ways of obtaining a second-order linear equation for the density perturbation variables. Then we systematically expand the covariant and gauge-invariant variables, recovering Bardeen's variables as first-order terms in this expansion: thus the two sets of variables are equivalent to first order. Through this comparison Bardeen's variables are shown to have a natural physical and geometrical meaning, which can be determined without the need of a gauge specification, and Bardeen's equations follow directly.},

We lay down a line of arguments that is -- thus far only qualitatively -- conclusive, and we address open problems of quantitative nature, related to the interpretation of observations. We discuss within a covariant framework (i) the foliation problem and invariant definitions of backreaction effects; (ii) the background problem and the notion of an effective cosmology; (iii) generalizations of the cosmological principle and generalizations of the cosmological equations; (iv) dark energies as energies of an effective scalar field; (v) the global gravitational instability of the standard model and basins of attraction for effective states; (vi) multiscale cosmological models and volume acceleration; (vii) effective metrics and strategies for effective distance measurements on the light cone, including observational predictions; (viii) examples of non-perturbative models, including explicit backreaction models for the LTB solution, extrapolations of the relativistic Lagrangian perturbation theory and scalar metric inhomogeneities. The role of scalar metric perturbations is critically examined and embedded into the non-perturbative framework.},

Contrary to the standard Friedmann equations, which hold for homogeneous-isotropic cosmologies, the new equations include the `backreaction effect' of inhomogeneities on the average expansion of the model. A universal relation between `backreaction' and average scalar curvature is also given. For cosmologies whose averaged spatial scalar curvature is proportional to $a_D^{-2}$, the expansion law governing a generic domain can be found. However, as the general equations show, `backreaction' acts as to produce average curvature in the course of structure formation, even when starting with space sections that are spatially flat on average.},

  Abstract                 = {We report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the three-dimensional correlation function of the transmitted flux fraction in the Lyalpha forest of high-redshift quasars. The study uses 48 640 quasars in the redshift range 2.1 <= z <= 3.5 from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III). At a mean redshift z = 2.3, we measure the monopole and quadrupole components of the correlation function for separations in the range 20 h-1 Mpc < r < 200 h-1 Mpc. A peak in the correlation function is seen at a separation equal to (1.01 +- 0.03) times the distance expected for the BAO peak within a concordance LambdaCDM cosmology. This first detection of the BAO peak at high redshift, when the universe was strongly matter dominated, results in constraints on the angular diameter distance DA and the expansion rate H at z = 2.3 that, combined with priors on H0 and the baryon density, require the existence of dark energy. Combined with constraints derived from cosmic microwave background observations, this result implies H(z = 2.3) = (224 +- 8) km s-1 Mpc-1, indicating that the time derivative of the cosmological scale parameter dot{a} = H(z = 2.3)/(1 + z) is significantly greater than that measured with BAO at z ~ 0.5. This demonstrates that the expansion was decelerating in the range 0.7 < z < 2.3, as expected from the matter domination during this epoch. Combined with measurements of H0, one sees the pattern of deceleration followed by acceleration characteristic of a dark-energy dominated universe.

Specifically, we derive the e-folding number of the phase of Ekpyrotic contraction which leads to a present-day anisotropy in agreement with current observational bounds.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a nonsingular bouncing cosmology using single scalar field matter with non-trivial potential and non-standard kinetic term. The potential sources a dynamical attractor solution with Ekpyrotic contraction which washes out small amplitude anisotropies. At high energy densities the field evolves into a ghost condensate, leading to a nonsingular bounce. Following the bounce there is a smooth transition to standard expanding radiation and matter dominated phases. Using linear cosmological perturbation theory we track each Fourier mode of the curvature fluctuation throughout the entire cosmic evolution. Using standard matching conditions for nonsingular bouncing cosmologies we verify that the spectral index does not change during the bounce. We show there is a controlled period of exponential growth of the fluctuation amplitude for the perturbations (but not for gravitational waves) around the bounce point which does not invalidate the perturbative treatment. This growth induces a natural suppression mechanism for the tensor to scalar ratio of fluctuations. Moreover, we study the generation of the primordial power spectrum of curvature fluctuations for various types of initial conditions. For the pure vacuum initial condition, on scales which exit the Hubble radius in the phase of Ekpyrotic contraction, the spectrum is deeply blue. For thermal particle initial condition, one possibility for generating a scale-invariant spectrum makes use of a special value of the background equation of state during the contracting Ekpyrotic phase. If the Ekpyrotic phase is preceded by a period of matter-dominated contraction, the primordial power spectrum is nearly scale-invariant on large scales (scales which exit the Hubble radius in the matter-dominated phase) but acquires a large blue tilt on small scales. Thus, our model provides a realization of the "matter bounce" scenario which is free of the anisotropy problem.},

  Abstract                 = {The full three-year WMAP results (WMAP3) reinforce the absence of large-angle correlations at scales greater than 60 degrees. The Poincare dodecahedral space (PDS) model model, which may naturally explain such features, thus remains a plausible cosmological model, despite recent controversy about whether matched circle searches would or would not push the topology beyond the horizon. Here, we have used new eigenmode calculations of the dodecahedral space to predict the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations in such models, with an improved angular resolution. We have simulated CMB maps and confirmed the expected presence of matching circles. For a set of plausible cosmological parameters, we have derived the angular power spectrum of the CMB up to large wavenumbers. Comparison with the WMAP3 observations confirms a remarkable fit with a PDS model, for a value $\Omega_0 = 1.018$ of the average total energy density.},

In general, a circle is detected as a circle of different radius, displaced relative to its original position, and centered at a point which does not correspond to its detected center in the comoving frame. Further, there is an angular displacement of points on the circles. These effects all arise from aberration of cosmic microwave background radiation, exhausting the purely geometric effects due to the peculiar motion of our galaxy, and are independent of both the large scale curvature of space and the expansion of the universe, since aberration is a purely local phenomenon.

Such conservative formulations of general relativistic kinetic theory in multiple spatial dimensions are presented in this paper, and their relevance to core-collapse supernova simulations is described.},

Directly adding all the K and evolution corrected $r$ band light to $M_r(0)=-18.5$, about $0.2L_\ast$, and correcting for the light below the limit, the average mass-to-light ratio of the clusters is $283\pm27h\msun/\lsun$ and the average mass per galaxy is $3.5\pm0.4\times10^{12}h^{-1}\msun$. The clusters are consistent with having a universal $M_v/L$ value (within the errors of about 20\%) independent of their velocity dispersion, mean color of their galaxies, blue galaxy content, redshift, or mean interior density. Using field galaxies within the same data set, with the same corrections, we find that the closure mass-to-light, $\rho_c/j$, is $1160\pm130h\msun/\lsun$ and the closure mass per galaxy, $\rho_c/\phi(>0.2L_\ast)$, is $13.2\pm1.9\times10^{12}h^{-1}\msun$. Under the assumptions that the galaxies are distributed like the mass and that the galaxy luminosities and numbers are statistically conserved, which these data indirectly support, $\Omega_0=0.20\pm0.04\pm0.09$ where the errors are, respectively, the $1\sigma$ internal and an estimate of the $1\sigma$ systematic error resulting from the luminosity normalization.},

A best guess for the matter density obtained by assuming a reasonable value for the Hubble constant and also by attempting to account for the baryons contained in the galaxies as well as those lost during the cluster formation process gives $\Omega_M \sim 0.25$. We also give preliminary results for the Hubble constant.

  Abstract                 = {Models of dark energy are conveniently characterized by the equation-of-state parameter w=p/\rho, where \rho is the energy density and p is the pressure. Imposing the Dominant Energy Condition, which guarantees stability of the theory, implies that w \geq -1. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that a well-defined model could (perhaps temporarily) have w<-1, and indeed such models have been proposed. We study the stability of dynamical models exhibiting w<-1 by virtue of a negative kinetic term. Although naively unstable, we explore the possibility that these models might be phenomenologically viable if thought of as effective field theories valid only up to a certain momentum cutoff. Under our most optimistic assumptions, we argue that the instability timescale can be greater than the age of the universe, but only if the cutoff is at or below 100 MeV. We conclude that it is difficult, although not necessarily impossible, to construct viable models of dark energy with w<-1; observers should keep an open mind, but the burden is on theorists to demonstrate that any proposed new models are not ruled out by rapid vacuum decay.},

  Abstract                 = {We perform a number of inter-related cosmographic fits to the legacy05 and gold06 supernova datasets. We pay particular attention to the influence of both statistical and systematic uncertainties, and also to the extent to which the choice of distance scale and manner of representing the redshift scale affect the cosmological parameters. While the "preponderance of evidence" certainly suggests an accelerating universe, we would argue that (based on the supernova data) this conclusion is not currently supported "beyond reasonable doubt". As part of the analysis we develop two particularly transparent graphical representations of the redshift-distance relation -- representations in which acceleration versus deceleration reduces to the question of whether the graph slopes up or down. Turning to the details of the cosmographic fits, three issues in particular concern us: First, the fitted value for the deceleration parameter changes significantly depending on whether one performs a chi^2 fit to the luminosity distance, proper motion distance, angular diameter distance, or other suitable distance surrogate. Second, the fitted value for the deceleration parameter changes significantly depending on whether one uses the traditional redshift variable z, or what we shall argue is on theoretical grounds an improved parameterization y=z/(1+z). Third, the published estimates for systematic uncertainties are sufficiently large that they certainly impact on, and to a large extent undermine, the usual purely statistical tests of significance. We conclude that the case for an accelerating universe is considerably less watertight than commonly believed.},

  Abstract                 = {Until recently, the physically relevant singularities occurring in FRW cosmologies had traditionally been thought to be limited to the "big bang", and possibly a "big crunch". However, over the last few years, the zoo of cosmological singularities considered in the literature has become considerably more extensive, with "big rips" and "sudden singularities" added to the mix, as well as renewed interest in non-singular cosmological events such as "bounces" and "turnarounds". In this talk, we present an extensive catalogue of such cosmological milestones, both at the kinematical and dynamical level. First, using generalized power series, purely kinematical definitions of these cosmological events are provided in terms of the behaviour of the scale factor a(t). The notion of a "scale-factor singularity" is defined, and its relation to curvature singularities (polynomial and differential) is explored. Second, dynamical information is extracted by using the Friedmann equations (without assuming even the existence of any equation of state) to place constraints on whether or not the classical energy conditions are satisfied at the cosmological milestones. Since the classification is extremely general, and modulo certain technical assumptions complete, the corresponding results are to a high degree model-independent.},

We find all the critical points of the system for constant equations of state in that range. We consider further several background quantities that can distinguish the models with different $w_X$ values. Using a simple toy model with a varying equation of state, we show that even a large variation of $w_X$ at small redshifts is very difficult to observe with $d_L(z)$ measurements up to $z\sim 1$. Therefore, it will require accurate measurements in the range $1<z<2$ and independent accurate knowledge of $\Omega_{m,0}$ (and/or $\Omega_{X,0}$) in order to resolve a variable $w_X$ from a constant $w_X$.},

  Abstract                 = {This white paper describes the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), whose goal is the study of dark energy and related topics in fundamental physics with data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). It provides an overview of dark energy science and describes the current and anticipated state of the field. It makes the case for the DESC by laying out a robust analytical framework for dark energy science that has been defined by its members and the comprehensive three-year work plan they have developed for implementing that framework. The analysis working groups cover five key probes of dark energy: weak lensing, large scale structure, galaxy clusters, Type Ia supernovae, and strong lensing. The computing working groups span cosmological simulations, galaxy catalogs, photon simulations and a systematic software and computational framework for LSST dark energy data analysis. The technical working groups make the connection between dark energy science and the LSST system. The working groups have close linkages, especially through the use of the photon simulations to study the impact of instrument design and survey strategy on analysis methodology and cosmological parameter estimation. The white paper describes several high priority tasks identified by each of the 16 working groups. Over the next three years these tasks will help prepare for LSST analysis, make synergistic connections with ongoing cosmological surveys and provide the dark energy community with state of the art analysis tools. Members of the community are invited to join the LSST DESC, according to the membership policies described in the white paper. Applications to sign up for associate membership may be made by submitting the Web form at http://www.slac.stanford.edu/exp/lsst/desc/signup.html with a short statement of the work they wish to pursue that is relevant to the LSST DESC.},

  Abstract                 = {The two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that the initial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and Gaussian - are rigorously tested using maps of the CMB anisotropy from the \Planck\ satellite. The detailed results are based on studies of four independent estimates of the CMB that are compared to simulations using a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model and incorporating essential aspects of the \Planck\ measurement process. Deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated to be robust against component separation algorithm, mask and frequency dependence. Many of these anomalies were previously observed in the \textit{WMAP} data, and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (around $3\sigma$). However, we find little evidence for non-Gaussianity with the exception of a few statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies. In particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connected to a low observed variance of the CMB signal. The dipolar power asymmetry is now found to persist to much smaller angular scales, and can be described in the low-$\ell$ regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. Finally, it is plausible that some of these features may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data which shows a deficit of power on the same scales. Indeed, when the power spectra of two hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, one shows evidence for a deficit in power, whilst its opposite contains oscillations between odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation and phase correlations also detected in the data. Whilst these analyses represent a step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactory explanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.},

Planck establishes an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio at r < 0.11 (95% CL). Planck data shrink the space of allowed standard inflationary models, preferring potentials with V'' < 0. Exponential potential models, the simplest hybrid inflationary models, and monomial potential models of degree n > 2 do not provide a good fit to the data. Planck does not find any statistically significant running of the scalar spectral index, obtaining d n_s/d ln k = -0.0134 pm 0.0090. Several analyses dropping the slow-roll approximation are carried out, including detailed model comparison and inflationary potential reconstruction. We investigate whether the primordial power spectrum contains any features. A penalized likelihood approach suggests a feature near the smallest scales probed by Planck at an estimated significance of ~3 sigma after correction for the look elsewhere effect. Models with a parameterized oscillatory feature can improve the fit chi^2 by ~ 10; however, Bayesian evidence does not prefer these models. We constrain several single-field inflation models with generalized Lagrangians by combining power spectrum data with bounds on f_NL measured by Planck. The fractional primordial contribution of CDM isocurvature modes in the curvaton and axion scenarios has upper bounds of 0.25% or 3.9% (95% CL), respectively. In models with arbitrarily correlated CDM or neutrino isocurvature modes, an anticorrelation can improve chi^2 by ~4 due to a moderate tension between l < 40 and higher multipoles. Nonetheless, the data are consistent with adiabatic initial conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the Planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of the two-point correlation function of the CMB temperature fluctuations. We use this likelihood to derive the Planck CMB power spectrum over three decades in l, covering 2 <= l <= 2500. The main source of error at l <= 1500 is cosmic variance. Uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumental noise dominate the error budget at higher l's. For l < 50, our likelihood exploits all Planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 GHz through a physically motivated Bayesian component separation technique. At l >= 50, we employ a correlated Gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectra derived from the 100, 143 and 217 GHz channels. We validate our likelihood through an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact of residual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters. We find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residuals of a few uK^2 at l <= 1000. We compare our results with foreground-cleaned CMB maps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 GHz Planck map, and find broad agreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. The best-fit LCDM cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary Planck polarisation spectra. The standard LCDM cosmology is well constrained by Planck by l <= 1500. For example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1. Considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indication of significant departures from the LCDM framework. Finally, we report a tension between the best-fit LCDM model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a power deficit of 5-10% at l <~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. We do not elaborate further on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our most puzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset. (Abridged)},

  Abstract                 = {We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95% upper limit of r<0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N_eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N_eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data. [Abridged]},

  Abstract                 = {We present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as a function of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the Planck SZ (PSZ) catalogue. The PSZ is selected through the signature of the Sunyaev--Zeldovich (SZ) effect, and the sub-sample used here has a signal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster and all but one with a redshift estimate. We discuss the calculation of the expected cluster counts as a function of cosmological parameters, the completeness of the sample, and the likelihood construction method. Using a relation between mass M and SZ signal Y based on comparison to X-ray measurements, we derive constraints on the power spectrum amplitude sigma_8 and matter density parameter \Omega_m in a flat LCDM model. We test the robustness of our estimates and find that possible biases in the Y-M relation and the halo mass function appear larger than the statistical uncertainties from the cluster sample. Assuming a bias between the X-ray determined mass and the true mass of 20%, motivated by comparison of the observed mass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we find that sigma_8(Omega_m/0.27)^0.3=0.78+-0.01, with one-dimensional ranges sigma_8=0.77+-0.02 and Omega_m=0.29+-0.02. The values of the cosmological parameters are degenerate with the mass bias, and it is found that the larger values of sigma_8 and Omega_m preferred by the Planck's measurements of the primary CMB anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass bias of about 45%. Alternatively, consistency with the primary CMB constraints can be achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scales, such as a component of massive neutrinos. We place our results in the context of other determinations of cosmological parameters, and discuss issues that need to be resolved in order to make progress in this field.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the first all-sky sample of galaxy clusters detected blindly by the Planck satellite through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect from its six highest frequencies. This early SZ (ESZ) sample is comprised of 189 candidates, which have a high signal-to-noise ratio ranging from 6 to 29. Its high reliability (purity above 95%) is further ensured by an extensive validation process based on Planck internal quality assessments and by external cross-identification and follow-up observations. Planck provides the first measured SZ signal for about 80% of the 169 previously-known ESZ clusters. Planck furthermore releases 30 new cluster candidates, amongst which 20 meet the ESZ signal-to-noise selection criterion. At the submission date, twelve of the 20 ESZ candidates were confirmed as new clusters, with eleven confirmed using XMM-Newton snapshot observations, most of them with disturbed morphologies and low luminosities. The ESZ clusters are mostly at moderate redshifts (86% with z below 0.3) and span more than a decade in mass, up to the rarest and most massive clusters with masses above 1 × 1015 M&sun;.

  Abstract                 = {A new 10 meter diameter telescope is being constructed for deployment at the NSF South Pole research station. The telescope is designed for conducting large-area millimeter and sub-millimeter wave surveys of faint, low contrast emission, as required to map primary and secondary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. To achieve the required sensitivity and resolution, the telescope design employs an off-axis primary with a 10m diameter clear aperture. The full aperture and the associated optics will have a combined surface accuracy of better than 20 microns rms to allow precision operation in the submillimeter atmospheric windows. The telescope will be surrounded with a large reflecting ground screen to reduce sensitivity to thermal emission from the ground and local interference. The optics of the telescope will support a square degree field of view at 2mm wavelength and will feed a new 1000-element micro-lithographed planar bolometric array with superconducting transition-edge sensors and frequency-multiplexed readouts. The first key project will be to conduct a survey over approximately 4000 degrees for galaxy clusters using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect. This survey should find many thousands of clusters with a mass selection criteria that is remarkably uniform with redshift. Armed with redshifts obtained from optical and infrared follow-up observations, it is expected that the survey will enable significant constraints to be placed on the equation of state of the dark energy.},

  Abstract                 = {The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) is designed to measure redshifts for approximately 250000 galaxies. This paper describes the survey design, the spectroscopic observations, the redshift measurements and the survey data base. The 2dFGRS uses the 2dF multifibre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which is capable of observing 400 objects simultaneously over a 2° diameter field. The source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the APM galaxy catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with extinction-corrected magnitudes brighter than bJ=19.45. The main survey regions are two declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere spanning 80°×15° around the SGP, and the other in the northern Galactic hemisphere spanning 75°×10° along the celestial equator; in addition, there are 99 fields spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers 2000deg2 and has a median depth of z=0.11. Adaptive tiling is used to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93 per cent over the whole survey region. Redshifts are measured from spectra covering 3600-8000{Å} at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0{Å} and a median S/N of 13pixel-1. All redshift identifications are visually checked and assigned a quality parameter Q in the range 1-5 Q>=3 redshifts are 98.4 per cent reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85kms-1. The overall redshift completeness for Q>=3 redshifts is 91.8 per cent, but this varies with magnitude from 99 per cent for the brightest galaxies to 90 per cent for objects at the survey limit.

We show that the microwave background will be identified at the intersections of the surface of last scattering as seen by different ``copies'' of the observer. Since the surface of last scattering is a two-sphere, these intersections will be circles, regardless of the background geometry or topology. We therefore propose a statistic that is sensitive to all small, locally homogeneous topologies. Here, small means that the distance to the surface of last scatter is smaller than the ``topology scale'' of the universe.},

  Abstract                 = {For bouncing cosmologies such as the ekpyrotic/cyclic scenarios we show that it is possible to make predictions for density perturbations which are independent of the details of the bouncing phase. This can be achieved, as in inflationary cosmology, thanks to the existence of a dynamical attractor, which makes local observables equal to the unperturbed solution up to exponentially small terms. Assuming that the physics of the bounce is not extremely sensitive to these corrections, perturbations can be evolved even at the nonlinear level. The resulting spectrum is not scale invariant and thus incompatible with experimental data. This can be explicitly shown in synchronous gauge where, contrary to what happens in the commonly used Newtonian gauge, all perturbations remain small going towards the bounce and the existence of the attractor is manifest.},

  Abstract                 = {Near-future cosmology will see the advent of wide-area photometric galaxy surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES), that extend to high redshifts (z˜ 1-2) but give poor radial distance resolution. In such cases splitting the data into redshift bins and using the angular correlation function w(), or the Cl power spectrum, will become the standard approach to extracting cosmological information or to studying the nature of dark energy through the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) probe. In this work we present a detailed model for w() at large scales as a function of redshift and binwidth, including all relevant effects, namely non-linear gravitational clustering, bias, redshift space distortions and photo-z uncertainties. We also present a model for the full covariance matrix, characterizing the angular correlation measurements, that takes into account the same effects as for w() and also the possibility of a shot-noise component and partial sky coverage. Provided with a large-volume N-body simulation from the MICE collaboration, we built several ensembles of mock redshift bins with a sky coverage and depth typical of forthcoming photometric surveys. The model for the angular correlation and the one for the covariance matrix agree remarkably well with the mock measurements in all configurations. The prospects for a full shape analysis of w() at BAO scales in forthcoming photometric surveys such as DES are thus very encouraging.},

  Abstract                 = {We exploit cosmological-model independent measurements of the expansion history of the Universe to provide a cosmic distance ladder. These are supernovae type Ia used as standard candles (at redshift between 0.01 and 1.3) and baryon acoustic oscillations (at redshifts between 0.1 and 0.8) as standard rulers. We calibrate (anchor) the ladder in two ways: first using the local $H_0$ value as an anchor at $z$ = 0 (effectively calibrating the standard candles) and secondly using the cosmic microwave background-inferred sound-horizon scale as an anchor (giving the standard ruler length) as an inverse distance ladder. Both methods are consistent, but the uncertainty in the expansion history $H(z)$ is smaller if the sound horizon scale is used. We present inferred values for the sound horizon at radiation drag $r_d$ which do not rely on assumptions about the early expansion history nor on cosmic microwave background measurements but on the cosmic distance ladder and baryon acoustic oscillations measurements. We also present derived values of $H_0$ from the inverse distance ladder and we show that they are in very good agreement with the derived value from the state-of-the art cosmic microwave background data for a $\Lambda$CDM model.},

We use a Fisher matrix analysis to study the improvements in the joint dark energy and cluster mass-observables constraints resulting from combining cluster counts and clustering abundances measured with different techniques. We use our formalism to forecast the constraints in Omega_DE and w from combining optical and SZ cluster counting on a 4000 sq. degree patch of sky. We find that this cross-calibration approach yields 2 times better constraints on Omega_DE and w compared to simply adding the Fisher matrices of the individually self-calibrated counts. The cross-calibrated constraints are less sensitive to variations in the mass threshold or maximum redshift range. A by-product of our technique is that the correlation between different mass-observables is well constrained without the need of additional priors on its value.},

For a set of idealized surveys, we evaluate cosmological constraints as priors on sixteen nuisance parameters in the halo modeling are varied. We find that surveys with a higher mass limit are more sensitive to mass-observable uncertainties while surveys with low mass limits that probe more of the mass function shape and evolution are more sensitive to mass function errors. We examine the correlations among nuisance and cosmological parameters. Mass function parameters are strongly positively (negatively) correlated with Omega_DE (w). For the mass-observable parameters, Omega_DE is most sensitive to the normalization and its redshift evolution while w is more sensitive to redshift evolution in the variance. While survey performance is limited mainly by mass-observable uncertainties, the current level of mass function error is responsible for up to a factor of two degradation in ideal cosmological constraints. For surveys that probe to low masses (10^13.5 h^-1 M_sun), even percent-level constraints on model nuisance parameters result in a degradation of ~ sqrt{2} (2) on Omega_DE (w) relative to perfect knowledge.},

In this paper, we extend this method and explore various applications of it, using both simulations of and real data from the SDSS. In addition to estimating the redshift distribution for an entire sample, the weighting method enables accurate estimates of the redshift probability distribution, p(z), for each galaxy in a photometric sample. Use of p(z) in cosmological analyses can substantially reduce biases associated with traditional photometric redshifts, in which a single redshift estimate is associated with each galaxy. The weighting procedure also naturally indicates which galaxies in the photometric sample are expected to have accurate redshift estimates, namely those that lie in regions of photometric-observable space that are well sampled by the spectroscopic subsample. In addition to providing a method that has some advantages over standard photo-z estimates, the weights method can also be used in conjunction with photo-z estimates, e.g., by providing improved estimation of N(z) via deconvolution of N(photo-z) and improved estimates of photo-z scatter and bias.

The deceleration parameter q(z) is obtained assuming only the validity of the FRW metric, allowing for a range of values of space curvature, and independent of a gravity theory and the physical nature of the contents of the universe. We show that q0 is independent of space curvature, and obtain q0=-0.48+/-0.11. The transition redshift when q0=0 is zT=0.78+0.08-0.27 for zero space curvature, and has a weak dependence on space curvature.

We present the results of a number of tests for possible systematic error and conclude that any effects are not significant compared to the statistical errors we quote. Where they overlap, we cross-correlate the ACT and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) maps and show they are consistent. The measurements of higher-order peaks in the CMB power spectrum provide an additional test of the ΛCDM cosmological model, and help constrain extensions beyond the standard model. The small angular scale power spectrum also provides constraining power on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and extragalactic foregrounds. We also present a measurement of the CMB gravitational lensing convergence power spectrum at 4.6σ detection significance.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyze the effect that peculiar velocities have on the cosmological inferences we make using luminosity distance indicators, such as Type Ia supernovae. In particular we study the corrections required to account for (1) our own motion, (2) correlations in galaxy motions, and (3) a possible local under- or overdensity. For all of these effects we present a case study showing the impact on the cosmology derived by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey (SDSS-II SN Survey). Correcting supernova (SN) redshifts for the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole slightly overcorrects nearby SNe that share some of our local motion. We show that while neglecting the CMB dipole would cause a shift in the derived equation of state of Δw ~ 0.04 (at fixed Ω m ), the additional local-motion correction is currently negligible (Δw <~ 0.01). We then demonstrate a covariance-matrix approach to statistically account for correlated peculiar velocities. This down-weights nearby SNe and effectively acts as a graduated version of the usual sharp low-redshift cut. Neglecting coherent velocities in the current sample causes a systematic shift of Δw ~ 0.02. This will therefore have to be considered carefully when future surveys aim for percent-level accuracy and we recommend our statistical approach to down-weighting peculiar velocities as a more robust option than a sharp low-redshift cut.},

  Abstract                 = {The first cosmological results from the ESSENCE supernova survey (Wood-Vasey et al. 2007) are extended to a wider range of cosmological models including dynamical dark energy and non-standard cosmological models. We fold in a greater number of external data sets such as the recent Higher-z release of high-redshift supernovae (Riess et al. 2007) as well as several complementary cosmological probes. Model comparison statistics such as the Bayesian and Akaike information criteria are applied to gauge the worth of models. These statistics favor models that give a good fit with fewer parameters. Based on this analysis, the preferred cosmological model is the flat cosmological constant model, where the expansion history of the universe can be adequately described with only one free parameter describing the energy content of the universe. Among the more exotic models that provide good fits to the data, we note a preference for models whose best-fit parameters reduce them to the cosmological constant model.},

This action is suited not only to perfect fluids with a barotropic equation of state, but also to those for which the pressure depends on two thermodynamical variables. By quantizing the system we find that (1) some perturbation fields exhibit a noncommutativity quite analogous to the one observed for a charged particle moving in a strong magnetic field, (2) local curvature and pressure perturbations cannot be measured simultaneously, (3) ghosts appear if the null energy condition is violated.},

After deriving the `brane-Friedmann' equations for a Z_2 symmetrical metric, we focus on the case of a Minkowski bulk. We show that there exist two classes of solutions, close to the usual Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology for small enough Hubble radii. When the Hubble radius gets larger one either has a transition to a fully 5D regime or to a self-inflationary solution which produces a late accelerated expansion. We also compare our results with a perturbative approach and eventually discuss the embedding of the brane into the Minkowski space-time. This latter part of our discussion also applies when no intrinsic curvature term is included.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a large class of scalar-tensor models with interactions containing the second derivatives of the scalar field but not leading to additional degrees of freedom. These models exhibit peculiar features, such as an essential mixing of scalar and tensor kinetic terms, which we have named kinetic braiding. This braiding causes the scalar stress tensor to deviate from the perfect-fluid form. Cosmology in these models possesses a rich phenomenology, even in the limit where the scalar is an exact Goldstone boson. Generically, there are attractor solutions where the scalar monitors the behaviour of external matter. Because of the kinetic braiding, the position of the attractor depends both on the form of the Lagrangian and on the external energy density. The late-time asymptotic of these cosmologies is a de Sitter state. The scalar can exhibit phantom behaviour and is able to cross the phantom divide with neither ghosts nor gradient instabilities. These features provide a new class of models for Dark Energy. As an example, we study in detail a simple one-parameter model. The possible observational signatures of this model include a sizeable Early Dark Energy and a specific equation of state evolving into the final de-Sitter state from a healthy phantom regime.},

  Abstract                 = {We reexamine the two-point correlation of density maxima in Gaussian initial conditions. Spatial derivatives of the linear density correlation, which were ignored in the calculation of Bardeen, Bond, Kaiser & Szalay (1986), are included in our analysis. These functions exhibit large oscillations around the sound horizon scale for generic CDM power spectra. We derive the exact leading-order expression for the correlation of density peaks and demonstrate the contribution of those spatial derivatives. In particular, we show that these functions can modify significantly the baryon acoustic signature of density maxima relative to that of the linear density field. The effect depends upon the exact value of the peak height, the filter shape and size, and the small-scale behaviour of the transfer function. In the LambdaCDM cosmology, for maxima identified in the density field smoothed at mass scale M\approx 10^{12}-10^{14}M_sun/h and with linear threshold height \nu=1.673/\sigma(M), the contrast of the BAO can be a few tens of percent larger than in the linear matter correlation. Overall, the BAO is amplified (damped) for threshold heights larger (less) than unity. Density maxima thus behave quite differently than linearly biased tracers of the density field, whose acoustic signature is a simple scaled version of the linear baryon acoustic oscillation. We also calculate the mean streaming of peak pairs in the quasi-linear regime. We show that the leading-order 2-point correlation and pairwise velocity of density peaks are consistent with a nonlinear, local biasing relation involving gradients of the density field. Biasing will be an important issue in ascertaining how much of the enhancement of the BAO in the primeval correlation of density maxima propagates into the late-time clustering of galaxies.},

  Abstract                 = {We present new results from a series of LCDM simulations of cluster mass halos resolved with high force and mass resolution. These results are compared with recently published simulations from groups using various codes including PKDGRAV, ART, TPM, GRAPE and GADGET. Careful resolution tests show that with 25 million particles within the high resolution region we can resolve to about 0.3\% of the virial radius and that convergence in radius is proportional to the mean interparticle separation. The density profiles of 26 high resolution clusters obtained with the different codes and from different initial conditions agree very well. The average logarithmic slope at one percent of the virial radius is $\gamma = 1.26$ with a scatter of $\pm 0.17$. Over the entire resolved regions the density profiles are well fitted by a smooth function that asymptotes to a central cusp $\rho \propto r^{-\gamma}$, where we find $\gamma=1.16\pm 0.14$ from the mean of the fits to our six highest resolution clusters.},

  Abstract                 = {The Atacama Cosmology Telescope has measured the angular power spectra of microwave fluctuations to arcminute scales at frequencies of 148 and 218 GHz, from three seasons of data. At small scales the fluctuations in the primordial Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) become increasingly obscured by extragalactic foregounds and secondary CMB signals. We present results from a nine-parameter model describing these secondary effects, including the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ and kSZ) power; the clustered and Poisson-like power from Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) sources, and their frequency scaling; the tSZ-CIB correlation coefficient; the extragalactic radio source power; and thermal dust emission from Galactic cirrus in two different regions of the sky. In order to extract cosmological parameters, we describe a likelihood function for the ACT data, fitting this model to the multi-frequency spectra in the multipole range 500 < l < 10000. We extend the likelihood to include spectra from the South Pole Telescope at frequencies of 95, 150, and 220 GHz. Accounting for different radio source levels and Galactic cirrus emission, the same model provides an excellent fit to both datasets simultaneously, with χ2/dof= 675/697 for ACT, and 96/107 for SPT. We then use the multi-frequency likelihood to estimate the CMB power spectrum from ACT in bandpowers, marginalizing over the secondary parameters. This provides a simplified `CMB-only' likelihood in the range 500 < l < 3500 for use in cosmological parameter estimation.},

  Abstract                 = {At low energy, the four-dimensional effective action of the ekpyrotic model of the universe is equivalent to a slightly modified version of the pre-big bang model. We discuss cosmological perturbations in these models. In particular we address the issue of matching the perturbations from a collapsing to an expanding phase. We show that, under certain physically motivated and quite generic assumptions on the high energy corrections, one obtains n=0 for the spectrum of scalar perturbations in the original pre-big bang model (with a vanishing potential). With the same assumptions, when an exponential potential for the dilaton is included, a scale invariant spectrum (n=1) of adiabatic scalar perturbations is produced under very generic matching conditions, both in a modified pre-big bang and ekpyrotic scenario. We also derive the resulting spectrum for arbitrary power law scale factors matched to a radiation-dominated era.},

We show that: (i) $\alpha$ must be $\la 1$; (ii) such a correction behaves like dark energy with equation-of-state $w_{\rm eff} = -1 + {\alpha \over 2}$ in the recent past ($10^4> z\gg 1$) and $w=-1$ in the distant future and can mimic $w<-1$ without violating the weak-energy condition; (iii) $w_{\rm eff}$ changes, $dz/dw|_{z\sim 0.5} \sim {\cal O}(0.2)$, which is likely detectable; and (iv) a future supernova experiment like SNAP that can determine $w$ with precision $\sigma_w$, could determine $\alpha$ to precision $\sigma_\alpha \approx 2 \sigma_w$.},

  Abstract                 = {We provide scaling relations and fitting formulae for adiabatic cold dark matter cosmologies that account for all baryon effects in the matter transfer function to better than 10\% in the large-scale structure regime. They are based upon a physically well-motivated separation of the effects of acoustic oscillations, Compton drag, velocity overshoot, baryon infall, adiabatic damping, Silk damping, and cold-dark-matter growth suppression. We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction exceeds $\Omega_0 h^2 + 0.2$, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter $\Gamma$.},

  Abstract                 = {The baryon acoustic oscillations are a promising route to the precision measure of the cosmological distance scale and hence the measurement of the time evolution of dark energy. We show that the nonlinear degradation of the acoustic signature in the correlations of low-redshift galaxies is a correctable process. By suitable reconstruction of the linear density field, one can sharpen the acoustic peak in the correlation function or, equivalently, restore the higher harmonics of the oscillations in the power spectrum. With this, one can achieve better measurements of the acoustic scale for a given survey volume. Reconstruction is particularly effective at low redshift, where the nonlinearities are worse but where the dark energy density is highest. At z=0.3, we find that one can reduce the sample variance error bar on the acoustic scale by at least a factor of 2 and in principle by nearly a factor of 4. We discuss the significant implications our results have for the design of galaxy surveys aimed at measuring the distance scale through the acoustic peak.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the large-scale correlation function measured from a spectroscopic sample of 46,748 luminous red galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The survey region covers 0.72 h^{-3} Gpc^3 over 3816 square degrees and 0.16<z<0.47, making it the best sample yet for the study of large-scale structure. We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100h^{-1} Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z=1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4\% fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5\% accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density Omega_mh^2 to 8\% and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find Omega_m = 0.273 +- 0.025 + 0.123 (1+w_0) + 0.137 Omega_K. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is Omega_K=-0.010+-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been known for a long time that the gauge problem plagues the study of density perturbations in cosmology. The quantity $\delta\mu/\mu (the fractional variation in density along a world line) usually determined in perturbation calculations is completely dependent on the gauge chosen. Even the fully covariant approach of Hawking (1966) is not immune. Bardeen's major paper (1980) determines a set of gauge-invariant quantities that are related to density perturbations but are not those perturbations themselves. We give a simple alternative representation of density fluctuations. This representation is both fully covariant and gauge invariant; thus it sidesteps the usual problems. The basic quantity used to represent density inhomogeneities is the comoving fractional gradient of the energy density orthogonal to the fluid flow. Our description does not make the usual assumption that this gradient is small. Exact (fully nonlinear) propagation equations are derived for this quantity. They are then linearized to give propagation equations appropriate to the case of an almost-Robertson-Walker universe. Their solutions are obtained in a simple case which can be compared with the standard theory; we recover the usual growing and decaying modes. Thus the result is standard, but its derivation is completely transparent. We give an interpretation of the Bardeen variables in terms of our formalism.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a precise estimate of the bulk virial scaling relation of halos formed via hierarchical clustering in an ensemble of simulated cold dark matter cosmologies. The result is insensitive to cosmological parameters, the presence of a trace, dissipationless gas component, and numerical resolution down to a limit of ~1000 particles. The dark matter velocity dispersion scales with total mass as log(sigma_{DM}(M,z)) = log(1082.9 +- 4.0 \kms) + (0.3361 +- 0.0026) log(h(z)M_{200}/10^{15} Msun), with h(z) the dimensionless Hubble parameter. At fixed mass, the velocity dispersion likelihood is nearly log-normal, with scatter sigma_{ln sigma} = 0.0426 +- 0.015, except for a tail to higher dispersions containing 10% of the population that are merger transients. We combine this relation with the halo mass function in LCDM models, and show that a low normalization condition, S_8 = sigma_8(Omega_m/0.3)^{0.35} \= 0.69, favored by recent WMAP and SDSS analysis requires that galaxy and gas specific energies in rich clusters be 50% larger than that of the underlying dark matter. Such large energetic biases are in conflict with the current generation of direct simulations of cluster formation. A higher normalization, S_8 = 0.80, alleviates this tension and implies that the hot gas fraction within r_{500} is (0.71 +- 0.09) h_{70}^{-3/2} Omega_b/\Omega_m, a value consistent with recent Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations.},

  Abstract                 = {We use giga-particle N-body simulations to study galaxy cluster populations in Hubble Volumes of LCDM (Omega_m=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7) and tCDM (Omega_m=1) world models. Mapping past light-cones of locations in the computational space, we create mock sky surveys of dark matter structure to z~1.4 over 10,000 sq deg and to z~0.5 over two full spheres. Calibrating the Jenkins mass function at z=0 with samples of ~1.5 million clusters, we show that the fit describes the sky survey counts to <~20\% acccuracy over all redshifts for systems larger than poor groups (M>5e13 Msun/h). Fitting the observed local temperature function determines the ratio beta of specific thermal energies in dark matter and intracluster gas. We derive a scaling with power spectrum normalization beta \propto sigma8^{5/3}, and measure a 4\% error on sigma8 arising from cosmic variance in temperature-limited cluster samples. Considering distant clusters, the LCDM model matches EMSS and RDCS X-ray-selected survey observations under economical assumptions for intracluster gas evolution. Using transformations of mass-limited cluster samples that mimic sigma8 variation, we explore SZ search expectations for a 10 sq deg survey complete above 10^{14} Msun/h. Cluster counts are shown to be extremely sensitive to sigma8 uncertainty while redshift statistics, such as the sample median, are much more stable. For LCDM, the characteristic temperature at fixed sky surface density is a weak function of redshift, implying an abundance of hot clusters at z>1. Assuming constant beta, four kT>8 keV clusters lie at z>2 and 40 kT>5 keV clusters lie at z>3 on the whole sky. Detection of Coma-sized clusters at z>1 violate LCDM at 95\% confidence if their surface density exceeds 0.003 per sq deg, or 120 on the whole sky.},

These equations were then used to calculate the spectrum index $n_s$ of quantum scalar perturbations of a non-singular inflationary quantum background model, which starts at infinity past from flat space-time with Planckian size spacelike hypersurfaces, and inflates due to a quantum cosmological effect, until it makes an analytical graceful exit from this inflationary epoch to a decelerated classical stiff matter expansion phase.

In a gauge analogous to the Coulomb gauge in electrodynamics it is possible to identify and quantize the independent degrees of freedom of the graviton field. The resulting theory is equivalent to that for a pair of massless minimally coupled scalar fields in the same background space-time. As an application of the formalism, the spectrum of gravitons produced by a power-law expansion of the universe is calculated and shown not to have any divergences.},

  Abstract                 = {We present here the final results of the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project to measure the Hubble constant. We summarize our method, the results and the uncertainties, tabulate our revised distances, and give the implications of these results for cosmology. The analysis presented here benefits from a number of recent improvements and refinements, including (1) a larger LMC Cepheid sample to define the fiducial period-luminosity (PL) relations, (2) a more recent HST Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) photometric calibration, (3) a correction for Cepheid metallicity, and (4) a correction for incompleteness bias in the observed Cepheid PL samples. New, revised distances are given for the 18 spiral galaxies for which Cepheids have been discovered as part of the Key Project, as well as for 13 additional galaxies with published Cepheid data. The new calibration results in a Cepheid distance to NGC 4258 in better agreement with the maser distance to this galaxy. Based on these revised Cepheid distances, we find values (in km/sec/Mpc) of H0 = 71 +/- 2 (random) +/- 6 (systematic) (type Ia supernovae), 71 +/- 2 +/- 7 (Tully-Fisher relation), 70 +/- 5 +/- 6 (surface brightness fluctuations), 72 +/- 9 +/- 7 (type II supernovae), and 82 +/- 6 +/- 9 (fundamental plane). We combine these results for the different methods with 3 different weighting schemes, and find good agreement and consistency with H0 = 72 +/- 8. Finally, we compare these results with other, global methods for measuring the Hubble constant.},

  Abstract                 = {A modification to the Friedmann Robertson Walker equation is proposed in which the universe is flat, matter dominated, and accelerating. An additional term, which contains only matter or radiation (no vacuum contribution), becomes the dominant driver of expansion at a late epoch of the universe. During the epoch when the new term dominates, the universe accelerates; we call this period of acceleration the Cardassian era. The universe can be flat and yet consist of only matter and radiation, and still be compatible with observations. The energy density required to close the universe is much smaller than in a standard cosmology, so that matter can be sufficient to provide a flat geometry. The new term required may arise, e.g., as a consequence of our observable universe living as a 3-dimensional brane in a higher dimensional universe. The Cardassian model survives several observational tests, including the cosmic background radiation, the age of the universe, the cluster baryon fraction, and structure formation.},

  Abstract                 = {We have simulated the formation of an X-ray cluster in a cold dark matter universe using 12 different codes. The codes span the range of numerical techniques and implementations currently in use, including SPH and grid methods with fixed, deformable or multilevel meshes. The goal of this comparison is to assess the reliability of cosmological gas dynamical simulations of clusters in the simplest astrophysically relevant case, that in which the gas is assumed to be non-radiative. We compare images of the cluster at different epochs, global properties such as mass, temperature and X-ray luminosity, and radial profiles of various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. On the whole, the agreement among the various simulations is gratifying although a number of discrepancies exist. Agreement is best for properties of the dark matter and worst for the total X-ray luminosity. Even in this case, simulations that adequately resolve the core radius of the gas distribution predict total X-ray luminosities that agree to within a factor of two. Other quantities are reproduced to much higher accuracy. For example, the temperature and gas mass fraction within the virial radius agree to about 10\%, and the ratio of specific kinetic to thermal energies of the gas agree to about 5\%. Various factors contribute to the spread in calculated cluster properties, including differences in the internal timing of the simulations. Based on the overall consistency of results, we discuss a number of general properties of the cluster we have modelled.},

  Abstract                 = {Faddeev and Jackiw's method for constrained systems is used to derive a gauge invariant formulation of cosmological perturbations in the one-bubble inflationary universe. For scalar perturbations in a flat universe, reduction of the action to the one with a single physical degree of freedom has been derived in the literature. A straightforward generalization of it to the case of an open universe is possible but it is not adequate for quantizing perturbations in the one-bubble universe, because of the lack of Cauchy surfaces inside the bubble. Therefore we perform the reduction of the action outside the light cone emanating from the center of the bubble or nucleation event, where the natural time constant hypersurfaces are no longer homogeneous and isotropic and as a result the conventional classification of perturbations in terms of scalar and tensor modes is not possible. Nevertheless, after reduction of the action we find three decoupled actions for three independent degrees of freedom, one of which corresponds to the scalar mode and the other two to the tensor modes. Implications for the one-bubble open inflationary models are briefly discussed. As an application of our formalism, the spectrum of long-wavelength gravity waves is simply obtained in terms of the real part of the reflection amplitude for a one-dimensional scattering problem, where the potential barrier is given in terms of the bubble profile.},

In particular, this extension provides a unified description of known cases such as the usual scalar field and the hydrodynamical perfect fluid. In addition, it applies to the recently proposed k-inflation, which is driven by non-minimal kinetic terms in the Lagrangian. The spectrum of quantum fluctuations for slow-roll and power law k-inflation is calculated. We find, for instance, that the usual ``consistency relation'' between the tensor spectral index and the relative amplitude of scalar and tensor perturbations is modified. Thus, at least in principle, k-inflation is phenomenologically distinguishable from standard inflation.},

We show that dilaton production, with a spectrum tilted towards large frequencies, emerges as a general property of this scenario. We discuss the frame independence of the dilaton spectrum and of the inflationary properties of the metric background by using, as model of source, a pressureless gas of weakly interacting strings, which is shown to provide an approximate but consistent solution to the full system of background equations and string equations of motion. We combine various cosmological bounds on a growing dilaton spectrum with the bound on the dilaton mass obtained from tests of the equivalence principle, and we find allowed windows compatible with a universe presently dominated by a relic background of dilatonic dark matter.},

  Abstract                 = {Well-calibrated scaling relations between the observable properties and the total masses of clusters of galaxies are important for understanding the physical processes that give rise to these relations. They are also a critical ingredient for studies that aim to constrain cosmological parameters using galaxy clusters. For this reason much effort has been spent during the last decade to better understand and interpret relations of the properties of the intra-cluster medium. Improved X-ray data have expanded the mass range down to galaxy groups, whereas SZ surveys have opened a new observational window on the intracluster medium. In addition, continued progress in the performance of cosmological simulations has allowed a better understanding of the physical processes and selection effects affecting the observed scaling relations. Here we review the recent literature on various scaling relations, focussing on the latest observational measurements and the progress in our understanding of the deviations from self similarity.},

We first give a complete description of the diffeomorphic classification of compact flat 3-manifolds, and derive the expressions for the injectivity radii, and for the volume of each class of Euclidean 3-manifolds. There emerges from our calculations the undetectability conditions for each (topological) class of flat universes. To illustrate the detectability of flat topologies we construct toy models by using an assumption by Bernshtein and Shvartsman which permits to establish a relation between topological typical lengths to the dynamics of flat models.},

Motivated by this result, we study the question of observational detection of possible non-trivial topologies in universes with $\Omega_0 \sim 1$, which include a cosmological constant. Using a number of indicators we find that as $\Omega_0 \to 1$, increasing families of possible manifolds (topologies) become either undetectable or can be excluded observationally. Furthermore, given a non-zero lower bound on $|\Omega_0 - 1|$, we can rule out families of topologies (manifolds) as possible candidates for the shape of our universe. We demonstrate these findings concretely by considering families of topologies and employing bounds on cosmological parameters from recent observations. We find that given the present bounds on cosmological parameters, there are families of both hyperbolic and spherical manifolds that remain undetectable and families that can be excluded as the shape of our universe. These results are of importance in future search strategies for the detection of the shape of our universe, given that there are an infinite number of theoretically possible topologies and that the future observations are expected to put a non-zero lower bound on $|\Omega_0 - 1|$ which is more accurate and closer to zero.},

The strength of these approaches is illustrated by extracting the topological signatures of a flat ($k=0$), an elliptic ($k=1$), and a hyperbolic ($k=-1$) multiply connected RW universes. We also show how separated contributions of the covering isometries add up to form the topological signature of a RW flat universe. There emerges from our theoretical results and simulations that the topological signature arises (in the mean) even when there are just a few images for each object. It is also shown that the mean pair separation histogram technique works, and that it is a suitable approach for studying the topological signatures of RW universes as well as the role of non-translational isometries.},

  Abstract                 = {If the universe is multiply connected and small the sky shows multiple images of cosmic objects, correlated by the covering group of the 3-manifold used to model it. These correlations were originally thought to manifest as spikes in pair separation histograms (PSH) built from suitable catalogues. Using probability theory we derive an expression for the expected pair separation histogram (EPSH) in a rather general topological-geometrical-observational setting. As a major consequence we show that the spikes of topological origin in PSH's are due to translations, whereas other isometries manifest as tiny deformations of the PSH corresponding to the simply connected case. This result holds for all Robertson-Walker spacetimes and gives rise to two basic corollaries: (i) that PSH's of Euclidean manifolds that have the same translations in their covering groups exhibit identical spike spectra of topological origin, making clear that even if the universe is flat the topological spikes alone are not sufficient for determining its topology; and (ii) that PSH's of hyperbolic 3-manifolds exhibit no spikes of topological origin. These corollaries ensure that cosmic crystallography, as originally formulated, is not a conclusive method for unveiling the shape of the universe. We also present a method that reduces the statistical fluctuations in PSH's built from simulated catalogues.},

  Abstract                 = {The energy conditions provide a very promising model-independent study of the current acceleration of the universe. However, in order to connect these conditions with observations, one often needs first to integrate them, and then find the corresponding constraints on some observational variables, such as the distance modulus. Those integral forms can be misleading, and great caution is needed when one interprets them physically. A typical example is that the transition point of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ is at about $z \simeq 0.76$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, with the same model when we consider the dimensionless Hubble parameter $E(z)$, which involves the integration of $q(z)$, we find that $E(z)$ does not cross the line of $q(z) = 0$ before $z = 2$. Therefore, to get the correct result, we cannot use the latter to determine the transition point. With these in mind, we carefully study the constraints from the energy conditions, and find that, among other things, the current observational data indeed strongly indicate that our universe has ocne experienced an accelerating expansion phase between the epoch of galaxy formation and the present.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new parametrization of the deceleration parameter to study its time-variation behavior. The advantage of parameterizing the deceleration parameter is that we do not need to assume any underlying theory of gravity. By fitting the model to the 157 gold sample supernova Ia data, we find strong evidence that the Universe is currently accelerating and it accelerated in the past. By fitting the model to the 115 nearby and Supernova Legacy Survey supernova Ia data, the evidence that the Universe is currently accelerating is weak, although there is still a strong evidence that the Universe once accelerated in the past. The results obtained from the 157 gold sample supernova Ia data and those from the 115 supernova Ia data are not directly comparable because the two different data sets measure the luminosity distance up to different redshifts. We then use the Friedmann equation and a dark energy parametrization to discuss the same problem. When we fit the model to the supernova Ia data alone, we find weak evidence that the Universe is accelerating and the current matter density is higher than that measured from other experiments. After we add the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to constrain the dark energy model, we find that the behavior of the deceleration parameter is almost the same as that obtained from parameterizing the deceleration parameter.},

The evolution of these fluctuations is followed through the time at which galactic scales come within Hubble radius (at approximately 10 to the 8th sec), and the energy density fluctuations delta-rho/rho at that time are estimated. It is noted that according to Harrison (1970) and Zeldovich (1972), this number should be about 0.0001 and should be roughly independent of scale. It is found that the new inflationary universe leads to a delta-rho/rho which is roughly independent of scale, but with a magnitude of approximately 50. It is therefore thought that a further modification of this scenario is necessary in order to make it workable.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the expected redshift evolution of galaxy cluster abundance between 0<~z<~3 in different cosmologies, including the effects of the cosmic equation of state parameter w=p/. Using the halo mass function obtained in recent large-scale numerical simulations, we model the expected cluster yields in a 12 deg2 Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) survey and a deep 104 deg2 X-ray survey over a wide range of cosmological parameters. We quantify the statistical differences among cosmologies using both the total number and redshift distribution of clusters. Provided that the local cluster abundance is known to a few percent accuracy, we find only mild degeneracies between w and either m or h. As a result, both surveys will provide improved constraints on m and w. The m-w degeneracy from both surveys is complementary to those found either in studies of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies or of high-redshift supernovae (SNe). As a result, combining these surveys together with either CMB or SNe studies can reduce the statistical uncertainty on both w and m to levels below what could be obtained by combining only the latter two data sets. Our results indicate a formal statistical uncertainty of ~3% (68% confidence) on both m and w when the SZE survey is combined with either the CMB or SN data; the large number of clusters in the X-ray survey further suppresses the degeneracy between w and both m and h. Systematics and internal evolution of cluster structure at the present pose uncertainties above these levels. We briefly discuss and quantify the relevant systematic errors. By focusing on clusters with measured temperatures in the X-ray survey, we reduce our sensitivity to systematics such as nonstandard evolution of internal cluster structure.},

The algorithm detects clusters by identifying the red sequence plus Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) feature, which is unique for galaxy clusters and does not exist among field galaxies. Red sequence clustering in color space is detected using an Error Corrected Gaussian Mixture Model. We run GMBCG on 8240 square degrees of photometric data from SDSS DR7 to assemble the largest ever optical galaxy cluster catalog, consisting of over 55,000 rich clusters across the redshift range from 0.1 < z < 0.55. We present Monte Carlo tests of completeness and purity and perform cross-matching with X-ray clusters and with the maxBCG sample at low redshift. These tests indicate high completeness and purity across the full redshift range for clusters with 15 or more members.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a detailed analysis of the two-point correlation function, from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). We estimate the redshift-space correlation function, xi(s), from which we measure the redshift-space clustering length, s_0=6.82+/-0.28 Mpc/h. We also estimate the projected correlation function, Xi(sigma), and the real-space correlation function, xi(r), which can be fit by a power-law, with r_0=5.05+/-0.26Mpc/h, gamma_r=1.67+/-0.03. For r>20Mpc/h, xi drops below a power-law as is expected in the popular LCDM model. The ratio of amplitudes of the real and redshift-space correlation functions on scales of 8-30Mpc/h gives an estimate of the redshift-space distortion parameter beta. The quadrupole moment of xi on scales 30-40Mpc/h provides another estimate of beta. We also estimate the distribution function of pairwise peculiar velocities, f(v), including rigorously the effect of infall velocities, and find that it is well fit by an exponential. The accuracy of our xi measurement is sufficient to constrain a model, which simultaneously fits the shape and amplitude of xi(r) and the two redshift-space distortion effects parameterized by beta and velocity dispersion, a. We find beta=0.49+/-0.09 and a=506+/-52km/s, though the best fit values are strongly correlated. We measure the variation of the peculiar velocity dispersion with projected separation, a(sigma), and find that the shape is consistent with models and simulations. Using the constraints on bias from recent estimates, and taking account of redshift evolution, we conclude that beta(L=L*,z=0)=0.47+/-0.08, and that the present day matter density of the Universe is 0.3, consistent with other 2dFGRS estimates and independent analyses.},

  Abstract                 = {A generally relativistic theory of thermodynamics is developed, based on four main physical principles: heat is a local form of energy, therefore described by a thermal energy tensor; conservation of mass, equivalent to conservation of heat, or the local first law; entropy is a local current; and non-destruction of entropy, or the local second law. A fluid is defined by the thermostatic energy tensor being isotropic. The entropy current is related to the other fields by certain equations, including a generalised Gibbs equation for the thermostatic entropy, followed by linear and quadratic terms in the dissipative (thermal minus thermostatic) energy tensor. Then the second law suggests certain equations for the dissipative energy tensor, generalising the Israel- Stewart dissipative relations, which describe heat conduction and viscosity including relativistic effects and relaxation effects. In the thermostatic case, the perfect-fluid model is recovered. In the linear approximation for entropy, the Eckart theory is recovered. In the quadratic approximation for entropy, the theory is similar to that of Israel & Stewart, but involving neither state-space differentials, nor a non-equilibrium Gibbs equation, nor non-material frames. Also, unlike conventional thermodynamics, the thermal energy density is not assumed to be purely thermostatic, though this is derived in the linear approximation. Otherwise, the theory reduces in the non- relativistic limit to the extended thermodynamics of irreversible processes due to Mueller. The dissipative energy density seems to be a new thermodynamical field, but also exists in relativistic kinetic theory of gases.},

  Abstract                 = {We measure the length of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature, and the expansion rate of the recent Universe, from low-redshift data only, almost model independently. We make only the following minimal assumptions: homogeneity and isotropy, a metric theory of gravity, a smooth expansion history, and the existence of standard candles (supernovæ) and a standard BAO ruler. The rest is determined by the data, which are compilations of recent BAO and type IA supernova results. Making only these assumptions, we find for the first time that the standard ruler has a length of 103.9 ±2.3 h-1 Mpc . The value is a measurement, in contrast to the model-dependent theoretical prediction determined with model parameters set by Planck data (99.3 ±2.1 h-1 Mpc ). The latter assumes the cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant, and that the ruler is the sound horizon at radiation drag. Adding passive galaxies as standard clocks or a local Hubble constant measurement allows the absolute BAO scale to be determined (142.8 ±3.7 Mpc ), and in the former case the additional information makes the BAO length determination more precise (101.9 ±1.9 h-1 Mpc ). The inverse curvature radius of the Universe is weakly constrained and consistent with zero, independently of the gravity model, provided it is metric. We find the effective number of relativistic species to be Neff=3.53 ±0.32 , independent of late-time dark energy or gravity physics.},

  Abstract                 = {Current and upcoming cosmological observations allow us to probe structures on smaller and smaller scales, entering highly nonlinear regimes. In order to obtain theoretical predictions in these regimes, large cosmological simulations have to be carried out. The promised high accuracy from observations make the simulation task very demanding: the simulations have to be at least as accurate as the observations. This requirement can only be fulfilled by carrying out an extensive code validation program. The first step of such a program is the comparison of different cosmology codes including gravitation interactions only. In this paper we extend a recently carried out code comparison project to include five more simulation codes. We restrict our analysis to a small cosmological volume which allows us to investigate properties of halos. For the matter power spectrum and the mass function, the previous results hold, with the codes agreeing at the 10\% level over wide dynamic ranges. We extend our analysis to the comparison of halo profiles and investigate the halo count as a function of local density. We introduce and discuss ParaView as a flexible analysis tool for cosmological simulations, the use of which immensely simplifies the code comparison task.},

  Abstract                 = {The gravitationally-driven evolution of cold dark matter dominates the formation of structure in the Universe over a wide range of length scales. While the longest scales can be treated by perturbation theory, a fully quantitative understanding of nonlinear effects requires the application of large-scale particle simulation methods. Additionally, precision predictions for next-generation observations, such as weak gravitational lensing, can only be obtained from numerical simulations. In this paper, we compare results from several N-body codes using test problems and a diverse set of diagnostics, focusing on a medium resolution regime appropriate for studying many observationally relevant aspects of structure formation. Our conclusions are that -- despite the use of different algorithms and error-control methodologies -- overall, the codes yield consistent results. The agreement over a wide range of scales for the cosmological tests is test-dependent. In the best cases, it is at the 5\% level or better, however, for other cases it can be significantly larger than 10\%. These include the halo mass function at low masses and the mass power spectrum at small scales. While there exist explanations for most of the discrepancies, our results point to the need for significant improvement in N-body errors and their understanding to match the precision of near-future observations. The simulation results, including halo catalogs, and initial conditions used, are publicly available.},

  Abstract                 = {For an arbitrary Tolman wormhole, unconstrained by symmetry, we shall define the bounce in terms of a three-dimensional edgeless achronal spacelike hypersurface of minimal volume. (Zero trace for the extrinsic curvature plus a "flare-out" condition.) This enables us to severely constrain the geometry of spacetime at and near the bounce and to derive general theorems regarding violations of the energy conditions--theorems that do not involve geodesic averaging but nevertheless apply to situations much more general than the highly symmetric FRW-based subclass of Tolman wormholes. [For example: even under the mildest of hypotheses, the strong energy condition (SEC) must be violated.] Alternatively, one can dispense with the minimal volume condition and define a generic bounce entirely in terms of the motion of test particles (future-pointing timelike geodesics), by looking at the expansion of their timelike geodesic congruences. One re-confirms that the SEC must be violated at or near the bounce. In contrast, it is easy to arrange for all the other standard energy conditions to be satisfied.},

  Abstract                 = {Luminous tracers have been used extensively to map the large-scale matter distribution in the Universe. Similarly the dynamics of stars or galaxies can be used to estimate masses of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. However, assumptions need to be made about the dynamical state or how well galaxies trace the underlying dark matter distribution. The gravitational tidal ?field a?ffects the paths of photons, leading to observable e?ffects. This phenomenon, gravitational lensing, has become an important tool in cosmology because it probes the mass distribution directly. In these lecture notes we introduce the main relevant quantities and terminology, but the subsequent discussion is mostly limited to weak gravitational lensing, the small coherent distortion of the shapes of distant galaxies by intervening structures. We focus on some of the issues in measuring accurate shapes and review the various applications of weak gravitational lensing, as well as some recent results.},

It is therefore important to compare both theoretical and observational results to a direct measure of the cluster mass. This can be done by measuring the gravitational lensing effects caused by the bending of light by the cluster mass distribution. In this review we discuss how this phenomenon can be used to determine cluster masses and study the mass distribution itself. As sample sizes increase, the accuracy of the weak lensing mass estimates needs to improve accordingly. We discuss the main practical aspects of these measurements. We review a number of applications and highlight some recent results.},

First, the mean number N(R) of LRGs within completely surveyed LRG-centered spheres of comoving radius R is shown to be proportional to R3 at radii greater than R~70h-1Mpc. The test has the virtue that it does not rely on the assumption that the LRG sample has a finite mean density; its results show, however, that there is such a mean density. Second, the survey sky area is divided into 10 disjoint solid angular regions, and the fractional rms density variations of the LRG sample in the redshift range 0.2<z<0.35 among these (~2×107h-3Mpc3) regions is found to be 7\% of the mean density. This variance is consistent with typical biased \Lambda CDM models and puts very strong constraints on the quality of SDSS photometric calibration.},

Estimating survey yields requires a detailed model for both cluster properties and the survey strategy. We address this by making mock observations of galaxy clusters in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The mock observatory consists of an interferometric array of ten 2.5 m diameter telescopes, operating at a central frequency of 30 GHz with a bandwidth of 8 GHz. For a survey covering 1 deg2 per month, we find that clusters with a mass above 2.5×1014 h-150 Msolar will be detected at any redshift, with the exact limit showing a modest redshift dependence. Using a Press-Schechter prescription for evolving the number densities of clusters with redshift, we determine that such a survey should find hundreds of galaxy clusters per year, many at high redshifts and relatively low mass-an important regime uniquely accessible to SZE surveys. Currently favored cosmological models predict ~25 clusters per deg2.},

  Abstract                 = {The distribution of dark matter in the halos that surround galaxies and galaxy clusters has been probed observationally, theoretically, and in numerical simulations. Yet there is still confusion about which of several suggested parameterized models is the better representation, and whether these models are truly universal. We use the observed temperature and density profiles of the intracluster medium of 11 relaxed galaxy clusters to investigate mass models for the dark matter halo using a thorough statistical analysis. We make careful comparisons between two- and three-parameter models, including the issue of a universal third parameter. We find that, of the two-parameter models, the NFW is still the best representation, but we also find moderate statistical evidence that a generalized three-parameter NFW model with a freely varying inner slope is preferred, despite penalizing against the extra degree of freedom. There is a strong indication that this inner slope needs to be determined for each cluster individually, some clusters have central cores and others have steep cusps. This implies that X-ray observations do not support the idea of a universal inner slope, but perhaps show a hint of a dependence with redshift or mass. The mass-concentration relation of our sample is in reasonable agreement with the latest predictions based on numerical simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {We explore extensions to the ΛCDM cosmology using measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the recent SPT-SZ survey, along with data from WMAP7 and measurements of H 0 and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO). We check for consistency within ΛCDM between these data sets, and find some tension. The CMB alone gives weak support to physics beyond ΛCDM, due to a slight trend relative to ΛCDM of decreasing power toward smaller angular scales. While it may be due to statistical fluctuation, this trend could also be explained by several extensions. We consider running of the primordial spectral index (dns /dln k), as well as two extensions that modify the damping tail power (the primordial helium abundance Yp and the effective number of neutrino species N eff) and one that modifies the large-scale power due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (the sum of neutrino masses ∑m ν). These extensions have similar observational consequences and are partially degenerate when considered simultaneously. Of the six one-parameter extensions considered, we find CMB to have the largest preference for dns /dln k with -0.046 < dns /dln k < -0.003 at 95% confidence, which strengthens to a 2.7σ indication of dns /dln k < 0 from CMB+BAO+H 0. Detectable dns /dln k ≠ 0 is difficult to explain in the context of single-field, slow-roll inflation models. We find N eff = 3.62 ± 0.48 for the CMB, which tightens to N eff = 3.71 ± 0.35 from CMB+BAO+H 0. Larger values of N eff relieve the mild tension between CMB, BAO, and H 0. When the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich selected galaxy cluster abundances (SPT_{CL}) data are also included, we obtain N eff = 3.29 ± 0.31. Allowing for ∑m ν gives a 3.0σ detection of ∑m ν > 0 from CMB+BAO+H 0 +SPT_{CL}. The median value is (0.32 ± 0.11) eV, a factor of six above the lower bound set by neutrino oscillation observations. All data sets except H 0 show some preference for massive neutrinos; data combinations including H 0 favor nonzero masses only if BAO data are also included. We also constrain the two-parameter extensions N eff + ∑m ν and N eff + Yp to explore constraints on additional light species and big bang nucleosynthesis, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {Cosmological parameter constraints from the CMB power spectra alone suffer several well-known degeneracies. These degeneracies can be broken by numerical artefacts and also a variety of physical effects that become quantitatively important with high-accuracy data e.g. from the Planck satellite. We study degeneracies in models with flat and non-flat spatial sections, non-trivial dark energy and massive neutrinos, and investigate the importance of various physical degeneracy-breaking effects. We test the CAMB power spectrum code for numerical accuracy, and demonstrate that the numerical calculations are accurate enough for degeneracies to be broken mainly by true physical effects (the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, CMB lensing and geometrical and other effects through recombination) rather than numerical artefacts. We quantify the impact of CMB lensing on the power spectra, which inevitably provides degeneracy-breaking information even without using information in the non-Gaussianity. Finally we check the numerical accuracy of sample-based parameter constraints using CAMB and COSMOMC. In an appendix we document recent changes to CAMB's numerical treatment of massive neutrino perturbations, which are tested along with other recent improvements by our degeneracy exploration results.},

  Abstract                 = {Through analytic techniques verified by numerical calculations, we establish general relations between the matter and cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra and their dependence on cosmological parameters on small scales. Fluctuations in the CMB, baryons, cold dark matter (CDM), and neutrinos receive a boost at horizon crossing. Baryon drag on the photons causes alternating acoustic peak heights in the CMB and is uncovered in its bare form under the photon diffusion scale. Decoupling of the photons at last scattering and of the baryons at the end of the Compton drag epoch, freezes the diffusion-damped acoustic oscillations into the CMB and matter power spectra at different scales. We determine the dependence of the respective acoustic amplitudes and damping lengths on fundamental cosmological parameters. The baryonic oscillations, enhanced by the velocity overshoot effect, compete with CDM fluctuations in the present matter power spectrum. We present new exact analytic solutions for the cold dark matter fluctuations in the presence of a growth- inhibiting radiation {\it and} baryon background. Combined with the acoustic contributions and baryonic infall into CDM potential wells, this provides a highly accurate analytic form of the small-scale transfer function in the general case.},

  Abstract                 = {The presence of dark energy in the Universe is inferred directly from the accelerated expansion of the Universe, and indirectly, from measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. Dark energy contributes about 2/3 of the critical density, is very smoothly distributed, and has large negative pressure. Its nature is very much unknown. Most of its discernible consequences follow from its effect on evolution of the expansion rate of the Universe, which in turn affects the growth of density perturbations and the age of the Universe, and can be probed by the classical kinematic cosmological tests. Absent a compelling theoretical model (or even a class of models), we describe the dark energy by an effective equation-of-state w=p_X/\rho_X which is allowed to vary with time. We describe and compare different approaches for determining w(t), including magnitude-redshift (Hubble) diagram, number counts of galaxies and clusters, and CMB anisotropy, focusing particular attention on the use of a sample of several thousand type Ia supernova with redshifts z\lesssim 1.7, as might be gathered by the proposed SNAP satellite. Among other things, we derive optimal strategies for constraining cosmological parameters using type Ia supernovae. While in the near term CMB anisotropy will provide the first measurements of w, supernovae and number counts appear to have the most potential to probe dark energy.},

We show that combining the supernova type Ia observations {\it with the constraints from WMAP observations} restricts large variation of $\rho(z)$ at low redshifts. The combination of these two observational constraints is stronger than either one. The results are completely consistent with the cosmological constant as the source of dark energy.},

  Abstract                 = {We place tight constraints on the redshift-averaged, effective value of the equation of state of dark energy, w, using only the absolute ages of Galactic stars and the observed position of the first peak in the angular power spectrum of the CMB. We find w<-0.8 at the 68\% confidence level. If we further consider that w > -1, this finding suggests that within our uncertainties, dark energy is indistinguishable from a classical vacuum energy term. We detect a correlation between the ages of the oldest galaxies and their redshift. This opens up the possibility of measuring w(z) by computing the relative ages of the oldest galaxies in the universe as a function of redshift, dz/dt. We show that this is a realistic possibility by computing dz/dt at z~0 from SDSS galaxies and obtain an independent estimate for the Hubble constant, H_0 = 69 \pm 12 km s-1 Mpc-1. The small number of galaxies considered at z>0.2 does not yield, currently, a precise determination of w(z), but shows that the age--redshift relation is consistent with a Standard LCDM universe with $w=-1$.},

We present non-parametric inversions of the 2D shear profiles to the mean 3D cluster density and mass profiles in bins of both optical richness and cluster i-band luminosity. We correct the inferred 3D profiles for systematic effects, including non-linear shear and the fact that cluster halos are not all precisely centered on their brightest galaxies. We also model the measured cluster shear profile as a sum of contributions from the brightest central galaxy, the cluster dark matter halo, and neighboring halos. We infer the relations between mean cluster virial mass and optical richness and luminosity over two orders of magnitude in cluster mass; the virial mass at fixed richness or luminosity is determined with a precision of 13\% including both statistical and systematic errors. We also constrain the halo concentration parameter and halo bias as a function of cluster mass; both are in good agreement with predictions of LCDM models. The methods employed here will be applicable to deeper, wide-area optical surveys that aim to constrain the nature of the dark energy, such as the Dark Energy Survey, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and space-based surveys.},

  Abstract                 = {We present significant improvements in cosmic distance measurements from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey, achieved by applying the reconstruction of the baryonic acoustic feature technique. We show using both data and simulations that the reconstruction technique can often be effective despite patchiness of the survey, significant edge effects and shot-noise. We investigate three redshift bins in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 1, and in all three find improvement after reconstruction in the detection of the baryonic acoustic feature and its usage as a standard ruler. We measure model-independent distance measures DV(rsfid/rs) of 1716 ± 83, 2221 ± 101, 2516 ± 86 Mpc (68 per cent CL) at effective redshifts z = 0.44, 0.6, 0.73, respectively, where DV is the volume-averaged distance, and rs is the sound horizon at the end of the baryon drag epoch. These significantly improved 4.8, 4.5 and 3.4 per cent accuracy measurements are equivalent to those expected from surveys with up to 2.5 times the volume of WiggleZ without reconstruction applied. These measurements are fully consistent with cosmologies allowed by the analyses of the Planck Collaboration and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We provide the DV(rsfid/rs) posterior probability distributions and their covariances. When combining these measurements with temperature fluctuations measurements of Planck, the polarization of Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 9, and the 6dF Galaxy Survey baryonic acoustic feature, we do not detect deviations from a flat Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model. Assuming this model, we constrain the current expansion rate to H0 = 67.15 ± 0.98 km s-1Mpc-1. Allowing the equation of state of dark energy to vary, we obtain wDE = -1.080 ± 0.135. When assuming a curved ΛCDM model we obtain a curvature value of ΩK = -0.0043 ± 0.0047.},

Mock catalogs of cluster counts expected from the surveys — eROSITA, WFXT, RCS2, DES and Planck, along with a mock dataset of follow-up mass calibrations are analyzed for this purpose. A fair agreement between MCMC and Fisher results is found only in the case of minimal models. However, for many cases, the marginalized constraints obtained from Fisher and MCMC methods can differ by factors of 30-100%. The discrepancy can be alarmingly large for a time dependent dark energy equation of state, w(a); the Fisher methods are seen to under-estimate the constraints by as much as a factor of 4-5. Typically, Fisher estimates become more and more inappropriate as we move away from ΛCDM, to a constant-w dark energy to varying-w dark energy cosmologies. Fisher analysis, also, predicts incorrect parameter degeneracies. There are noticeable offsets in the likelihood contours obtained from Fisher methods that is caused due to an asymmetry in the posterior likelihood distribution as seen through a MCMC analysis. From the point of mass-calibration uncertainties, a high value of unknown scatter about the mean mass-observable relation, and its redshift dependence, is seen to have large degeneracies with the cosmological parameters σ8 and w(a) and can degrade the cosmological constraints considerably. We find that the addition of mass-calibrated cluster datasets can improve dark energy and σ8 constraints by factors of 2-3 from what can be obtained from CMB+SNe+BAO only . Finally, we show that a joint analysis of datasets of two (or more) different cluster surveys would significantly tighten cosmological constraints from using clusters only. Since, details of future cluster surveys are still being planned, we emphasize that optimal survey design must be done using MCMC analysis rather than Fisher forecasting.},

For the physical conditions relevant to the ekpyrotic scenario, we reobtain our earlier result of a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of energy density perturbations.

Furthermore, violation of the null energy condition can occur without any instabilities. As a result, the spectral index of tensor modes can be blue, which makes it easier to observe quantum gravitational waves from inflation by the planned gravitational-wave experiments such as LISA and DECIGO as well as by the upcoming CMB experiments such as Planck and CMBpol.},

  Abstract                 = {(Abridged) The WMAP 5-year data strongly limit deviations from the minimal LCDM model. We constrain the physics of inflation via Gaussianity, adiabaticity, the power spectrum shape, gravitational waves, and spatial curvature. We also constrain the properties of dark energy, parity-violation, and neutrinos. We detect no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The parameters of the LCDM model, derived from WMAP combined with the distance measurements from the Type Ia supernovae (SN) and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), are: Omega_b=0.0456+-0.0015, Omega_c=0.228+-0.013, Omega_Lambda=0.726+-0.015, H_0=70.5+-1.3 km/s/Mpc, n_s=0.960+-0.013, tau=0.084+-0.016, and sigma_8=0.812+-0.026. With WMAP+BAO+SN, we find the tensor-to-scalar ratio r<0.22 (95\% CL), and n_s>1 is disfavored regardless of r. We obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) equation of state of dark energy and curvature. We provide a set of "WMAP distance priors," to test a variety of dark energy models. We test a time-dependent w with a present value constrained as -0.33<1+w_0<0.21 (95\% CL). Temperature and matter fluctuations obey the adiabatic relation to within 8.9\% and 2.1\% for the axion and curvaton-type dark matter, respectively. The TE and EB spectra constrain cosmic parity-violation. We find the limit on the total mass of neutrinos, sum(m_nu)<0.67 eV (95\% CL), which is free from the uncertainty in the normalization of the large-scale structure data. The effective number of neutrino species is constrained as N_{eff} = 4.4+-1.5 (68\%), consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Finally, limits on primordial non-Gaussianity are -9<f_NL^{local}<111 and -151<f_NL^{equil}<253 (95\% CL) for the local and equilateral models, respectively.},

We review the main mathematical properties of multi--connected spaces, and the different tools to classify them and to analyse their properties. Following the mathematical classification, we describe the different possible muticonnected spaces which may be used to construct universe models. We briefly discuss some implications of multi--connectedness for quantum cosmology, and its consequences concerning quantum field theory in the early universe. We consider in details the properties of the cosmological models where space is multi--connected, with emphasis towards observable effects. We then review the analyses of observational results obtained in this context, to search for a possible signature of multi--connectedness, or to constrain the models. They may concern the distribution of images of cosmic objects like galaxies, clusters, quasars,..., or more global effects, mainly those concerning the Cosmic Microwave Background, and the present limits resulting from them.},

Our analysis includes k-inflation, Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation and its multi-field extensions which have been recently studied. For this general class of models, we calculate the action to second order in the linear perturbations. We decompose the perturbations into an adiabatic mode, parallel to the background trajectory, and entropy modes. We show that all the entropy modes propagate with the speed of light whereas the adiabatic mode propagates with an effective speed of sound. We also identify the specific combination of entropy modes which sources the curvature perturbation on large scales. We then study in some detail the case of two scalar fields: we write explicitly the equations of motion for the adiabatic and entropy modes in a compact form and discuss their quantum fluctuations and primordial power spectra.},

  Abstract                 = {Euclid is a space-based survey mission from the European Space Agency designed to understand the origin of the Universe's accelerating expansion. It will use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark matter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. The mission is optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field of view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of ~0.54 deg2: the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) < 0.05. They are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from public data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless spectrometer, with spectral resolution ~250, predominantly detects Ha emission line galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. This report (also known as the Euclid Red Book) describes the outcome of the Phase A study.},

J. 612:652, 2004; Astrophys. J. 677:1, 2008). Our results, using updated SNeIa and GRBs, allow to highlight some of the intrinsic weaknesses of the method. Conclusions on the main dark energy features as drawn from this method are intimately related to the features of the samples themselves, particularly for GRBs, which are poor performers in this context and cannot be used for cosmological purposes, that is, the state of the art does not allow to regard them on the same quality basis as SNeIa. We find there is a considerable sensitivity to some parameters (window width, overlap, selection criteria) affecting the results. Then, we try to establish what the current redshift range is for which one can make solid predictions on dark energy evolution. Finally, we strengthen the former view that this model is modest in the sense it provides only a picture of the global trend and has to be managed very carefully. But, on the other hand, we believe it offers an interesting complement to other approaches, given that it works on minimal assumptions.},

A new prediction, given the Planck 2013 constraints on the bispectrum, is a sharp constraint on the local trispectrum parameter g_{NL}; namely, the simplest models predict it is negative, with g_{NL} < -1700.},

Next we apply the crystallographic method, aimed to detect a topological signal in the 3D distance histogram between images, to compact hyperbolic models. Numerical calculations in the Weeks manifold allows us to check the absence of crystallographic signature of topology, due to the fact that the number of copies of the fundamental domain in the observable covering space is low and that the points are not moved the same distance by the holonomies of space.},

The lensing signal can also be used to help constrain cosmological parameters and lensing mass distributions. We review the origin and calculation of these effects. Topics include: lensing in General Relativity, the lensing potential, lensed temperature and polarization power spectra, implications for constraining inflation, non-Gaussian structure, reconstruction of the lensing potential, delensing, sky curvature corrections, simulations, cosmological parameter estimation, cluster mass reconstruction, and moving lenses/dipole lensing.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an empirical method for estimating the underlying redshift distribution N(z) of galaxy photometric samples from photometric observables. The method does not rely on photometric redshift (photo-z) estimates for individual galaxies, which typically suffer from biases. Instead, it assigns weights to galaxies in a spectroscopic subsample such that the weighted distributions of photometric observables (e.g., multi-band magnitudes) match the corresponding distributions for the photometric sample. The weights are estimated using a nearest-neighbor technique that ensures stability in sparsely populated regions of color-magnitude space. The derived weights are then summed in redshift bins to create the redshift distribution. We apply this weighting technique to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as well as to mock catalogs for the Dark Energy Survey, and compare the results to those from the estimation of photo-z's derived by a neural network algorithm. We find that the weighting method accurately recovers the underlying redshift distribution, typically better than the photo-z reconstruction, provided the spectroscopic subsample spans the range of photometric observables covered by the photometric sample.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to constrain dark energy from the evolution of galaxy cluster counts is limited by the imperfect knowledge of cluster redshifts. Ongoing and upcoming surveys will mostly rely on redshifts estimated from broad-band photometry (photo-z's). For a Gaussian distribution for the cluster photo-z errors and a high cluster yield cosmology defined by the WMAP 1 year results, the photo-z bias and scatter needs to be known better than 0.003 and 0.03, respectively, in order not to degrade dark energy constrains by more than 10\% for a survey with specifications similar to the South Pole Telescope. Smaller surveys and cosmologies with lower cluster yields produce weaker photo-z requirements, though relative to worse baseline constraints. Comparable photo-z requirements are necessary in order to employ self-calibration techniques when solving for dark energy and observable-mass parameters simultaneously. On the other hand, self-calibration in combination with external mass inferences helps reduce photo-z requirements and provides important consistency checks for future cluster surveys. In our fiducial model, training sets with spectroscopic redshifts for ~5\%-15\% of the detected clusters are required in order to keep degradations in the dark energy equation of state lower than 20\%.},

  Abstract                 = {The exponential sensitivity of cluster number counts to the properties of the dark energy implies a comparable sensitivity to not only the mean but also the actual_distribution_ of an observable mass proxy given the true cluster mass. For example a 25\% scatter in mass can provide a ~50\% change in the number counts at z~2 for the upcoming SPT survey. Uncertainty in the scatter of this amount would degrade dark energy constraints to uninteresting levels. Given the shape of the actual mass function, the properties of the distribution may be internally monitored by the shape of the_observable_ mass function. An arbitrary evolution of the scatter of a mass-independent Gaussian distribution may be self-calibrated to allow a measurement of the dark energy equation of state of Delta w ~0.1. External constraints on the mass_variance_ of the distribution that are more accurate than Delta var < 0.01 at z~1 can further improve constraints by up to a factor of 2. More generally, cluster counts and their sample variance measured as a function of the observable provide internal consistency checks on the assumed form of the observable-mass distribution that will protect against misinterpretation of the dark energy constraints.},

Next generation surveys with ~10000 clusters will have sufficient statistics to enable some degree of self-calibration. The excess variance of counts due to the clustering of clusters provides such an opportunity and can be measured from the survey without additional observational cost. It can minimize the degradation in dark energy constraints due to an unknown power law evolution in the mass-observable relation improving constraints on the dark energy equation of state by a factor of 2 or more to sigma(w)=0.06 for a deep 4000 deg2 survey.},

  Abstract                 = {The energy conditions play an important role in the understanding of several properties of the Universe, including the current accelerating expansion phase and the possible existence of the so-called phantom fields. We show that the integrated bounds provided by the energy conditions on cosmological observables such as the distance modulus $\mu(z)$ and the lookback time $t_L(z)$ are not sufficient (nor necessary) to ensure the local fulfillment of the energy conditions, making explicit the limitation of these bounds in the confrontation with observational data. We recast the energy conditions as bounds on the deceleration and normalized Hubble parameters, obtaining new bounds which are necessary and sufficient for the local fulfillment of the energy conditions. A statistical confrontation, with $1\sigma-3\sigma$ confidence levels, between our bounds and supernovae data from the gold and combined samples is made for the recent past. Our analyses indicate, with $3\sigma$ confidence levels, the fulfillment of both the weak energy condition (WEC) and dominant energy condition (DEC) for $z \leq 1$ and $z \lesssim 0.8$, respectively. In addition, they suggest a possible recent violation of the null energy condition (NEC) with $3\sigma$, i.e. a very recent phase of super-acceleration. Our analyses also show the possibility of violation of the strong energy condition (\textbfSEC) with $3\sigma$ in the recent past ($z \leq 1$), but interestingly the $q(z)$-best-fit curve crosses the SEC-fulfillment divider at $z \simeq 0.67$, which is a value very close to the beginning of the epoch of cosmic acceleration predicted by the standard concordance flat $\Lambda$CDM scenario.},

We show that the error in ordinary Limber approximation is O(ℓ-2). We also provide a simple expression for the 2nd order correction to the Limber formula, which improves the accuracy to O(ℓ-4). This correction can be especially useful for narrow redshift bins, or samples with small redshift overlap, for which the 0th order Limber formula has a large error. We also point out that using ℓ instead of ℓ+1/2, as is often done in the literature, spoils the accuracy of the approximation to O(ℓ-1).},

  Abstract                 = {Cosmology's standard model posits an infinite flat universe forever expanding under the pressure of dark energy. First-year data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) confirm this model to spectacular precision on all but the largest scales (Bennett {\it et al.}, 2003 ; Spergel {\it et al.}, 2003). Temperature correlations across the microwave sky match expectations on scales narrower than $60^{\circ}$, yet vanish on scales wider than $60^{\circ}$. Researchers are now seeking an explanation of the missing wide-angle correlations (Contaldi {\it et al.}, 2003 ; Cline {\it et al.}, 2003). One natural approach questions the underlying geometry of space, namely its curvature (Efstathiou, 2003) and its topology (Tegmark {\it et al.}, 2003). In an infinite flat space, waves from the big bang would fill the universe on all length scales. The observed lack of temperature correlations on scales beyond $60^{\circ}$ means the broadest waves are missing, perhaps because space itself is not big enough to support them. Here we present a simple geometrical model of a finite, positively curved space -- the Poincar\'e dodecahedral space -- which accounts for WMAP's observations with no fine-tuning required. Circle searching (Cornish, Spergel and Starkman, 1998) may confirm the model's topological predictions, while upcoming Planck Surveyor data may confirm its predicted density of $\Omega_0 \simeq 1.013 > 1$. If confirmed, the model will answer the ancient question of whether space is finite or infinite, while retaining the standard Friedmann-Lema\^\i{}tre foundation for local physics.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a systematic treatment of the linear theory of scalar gravitational perturbations in the synchronous gauge and the conformal Newtonian (or longitudinal) gauge. It differs from others in the literature in that we give, in both gauges, a complete discussion of all particle species that are relevant to any flat cold dark matter (CDM), hot dark matter (HDM), or CDM + HDM models (including a possible cosmological constant). The particles considered include CDM, baryons, photons, massless neutrinos, and massive neutrinos (an HDM candidate), where the CDM and baryons are treated as fluids while a detailed phase-space description is given to the photons and neutrinos. Particular care is applied to the massive neutrino component, which has been either ignored or approximated crudely in previous works. Isentropic initial conditions on superhorizon scales are derived. The coupled, linearized Boltzmann, Einstein, and fluid equations that govern the evolution of the metric and density perturbations are then solved numerically in both gauges for the standard CDM model and two CDM + HDM models with neutrino mass densities Omega_nu = 0.2 and 0.3, assuming a scale-invariant, adiabatic spectrum of primordial fluctuations. We also give the full details of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, and present the first accurate calculations of the angular power spectra in the two CDM + HDM models including photon polarization, higher neutrino multipole moments, and helium recombination. The numerical programs for both gauges are available at http://arcturus.mit.edu/cosmics.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the prospects for measuring the dark energy equation of state parameter w within the context of any uncertain redshift evolution of galaxy cluster structure (building on Majumdar and Mohr, 2003) and show that including the redshift averaged cluster power spectrum, P_cl(k), and direct mass measurements of 100 clusters helps tremendously in reducing cosmological parameter uncertainties. Specifically, we show that when combining the redshift distribution and the power spectrum information for a particular X-ray survey (DUET) and two SZE surveys (SPT & Planck), the constraints on the dark energy equation of state w can be improved by roughly a factor of 4. Because surveys designed to study the redshift distribution of clusters will have all the information necessary to construct P_cl(k), the benefit of adding P_cl(k) in reducing uncertainties comes at no additional observational cost. Combining detailed mass studies of 100 clusters with the redshift distribution improves the parameter uncertainties by a factor of 3-5. The data required for these detailed mass measurements-- assumed to have 1sigma uncertainties of 30-- are accumulating in the the XMM-Newton and Chandra archives. The best constraints are obtained when one combines both the power spectrum constraints and mass measurements with the cluster redshift distribution; when using the survey to extract the parameters and evolution of the mass--observable relations, we estimate the uncertainties on w of ~4\% to 6\%. These parameter constraints are obtained from self-calibrating cluster surveys alone. In combination with CMB or distance measurements that have different parameter degeneracies, cluster studies of dark energy will provide enhanced constraints and allow for cross--checks of systematics.},

  Abstract                 = {Cosmic crystallography is based on the principle that peaks in the pair separation histogram (PSH) of objects in a catalogue should be induced by the high number of topologically lensed pairs that are separated by Clifford translations, in excess to ``random'' pairs of objects. Here we present modifications of this method that successively improve the signal-to-noise ratio by removing a large part of the noise and then false signals induced by selection effects. Given the transient nature of the most readily available tracer objects, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the former is possible because a natural filter for removing many of the noise pairs is available: when counting pairs of objects in order to create PSHs, only those with nearly identical redshifts need to be counted. This redshift filter (a maximum value of $\Delta z/z = 0.005$) was applied to a compilation of AGN catalogues. Further noise was removed by applying a second filter, a maximum angle $\Delta \theta =0.075$ rad, and a minimum number of pairs $\protect\npairs=3$ to find each ``bunch of pairs'' (BoP) where the {\em vectors} (in Euclidean comoving space) defined by pairs are required to be nearly equal, whereas in the PSH only the {\em lengths} must be nearly equal. These filters reveal significant signals, which, however, are due to selection effects. A third filter, a minimum length $\Lselec=150$ {\hMpc} between the (parallel) vectors in a BoP, is found to effectively remove these selection effect pairs. After application of these successive filters, no significant topological signal was found.},

All SZ detections announced in this work have confirmed optical counterparts. Ten of the clusters are new discoveries. One newly discovered cluster, ACT-CL J0102-4915, with a redshift of 0.75 (photometric), has an SZ decrement comparable to the most massive systems at lower redshifts. Simulations of the cluster recovery method reproduce the sample purity measured by optical follow-up. In particular, for clusters detected with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than six, simulations are consistent with optical follow-up that demonstrated this subsample is 100% pure. The simulations further imply that the total sample is 80% complete for clusters with mass in excess of 6 × 1014 solar masses referenced to the cluster volume characterized by 500 times the critical density. The Compton y-X-ray luminosity mass comparison for the 11 best-detected clusters visually agrees with both self-similar and non-adiabatic, simulation-derived scaling laws.},

  Abstract                 = {In most current models of inflation based on a weakly self-coupled scalar matter field minimally coupled to gravity, the period of inflation lasts so long that, at the beginning of the inflationary period, the physical wavelengths of comoving scales which correspond to the present large-scale structure of the Universe were smaller than the Planck length. Thus, the usual computations of the spectrum of fluctuations in these models involve extrapolating low-energy physics (both in the matter and gravitational sector) into regions where this physics is not applicable. In this article we study the dependence of the usual predictions of inflation for the spectrum of cosmological fluctuations on the hidden assumptions about super-Planck scale physics. We introduce a class of modified dispersion relations to mimic possible effects of super-Planck scale physics, and find that, given an initial state determined by minimizing the energy density, for dispersions relations introduced by Unruh the spectrum is unchanged, whereas for a class of dispersion relations similar to those used by Corley and Jacobson (which involve a more radical departure from the usual linear relation) important deviations from the usual predictions of inflation can be obtained. Some implications of this result for the unification of fundamental physics and early Universe cosmology are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {By considering a simplified but exact model for realizing the ekpyrotic scenario, we clarify various assumptions that have been used in the literature. In particular, we discuss the new ekpyrotic prescription for passing the perturbations through the singularity which we show to provide a spectrum depending on a nonphysical normalization function. We also show that this prescription does not reproduce the exact result for a sharp transition. Then, more generally, we demonstrate that, in the only case where a bounce can be obtained in Einstein general relativity without facing singularities and/or violation of the standard energy conditions, the bounce cannot be made arbitrarily short. This contrasts with the standard (inflationary) situation where the transition between two eras with different values of the equation of state can be considered as instantaneous. We then argue that the usually conserved quantities are not constant on a typical bounce time scale. Finally, we also examine the case of a test scalar field (or gravitational waves) where similar results are obtained. We conclude that the full dynamical equations of the underlying theory should be solved in a nonsingular case before any conclusion can be drawn.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the nature of cluster selection in Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) surveys, focusing on single frequency observations and using Monte Carlo simulations incorporating instrumental effects, primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and extragalactic point sources. Clusters are extracted from simulated maps with an optimal, multi-scale matched filter. We introduce a general definition for the survey selection function that provides a useful link between an observational catalog and theoretical predictions. The selection function defined over the observed quantities of flux and angular size is independent of cluster physics and cosmology, and thus provides a useful characterization of a survey. Selection expressed in terms of cluster mass and redshift, on the other hand, depends on both cosmology and cluster physics. We demonstrate that SZ catalogs are not simply flux limited, and illustrate how incorrect modeling of the selection function leads to biased estimates of cosmological parameters. The fact that SZ catalogs are not flux limited complicates survey ``calibration'' by requiring more detailed information on the relation between cluster observables and cluster mass.},

In this review, I focus on the most recent results obtained during the last five years from the analysis of the weak lensing regime. The potential of weak lensing as a probe of dark matter and the study of the coupling between light and mass on scales of clusters of galaxies, large-scale structures and galaxies is discussed first. Then I present the impact of weak lensing for the study of distant galaxies and of the population of lensed sources as a function of redshift. Finally, I discuss the potential of weak lensing to constrain the cosmological parameters, either from pure geometrical effects observed in peculiar lenses, or from the coupling of weak lensing with the CMB.},

  Abstract                 = {eROSITA is the primary instrument on the Russian SRG mission. In the first four years of scientific operation after its launch, foreseen for 2014, it will perform a deep survey of the entire X-ray sky. In the soft X-ray band (0.5-2 keV), this will be about 20 times more sensitive than the ROSAT all sky survey, while in the hard band (2-10 keV) it will provide the first ever true imaging survey of the sky at those energies. Such a sensitive all-sky survey will revolutionize our view of the high-energy sky, and calls for major efforts in synergic, multi-wavelength wide area surveys in order to fully exploit the scientific potential of the X-ray data. The design-driving science of eROSITA is the detection of very large samples (~10^5 objects) of galaxy clusters out to redshifts z>1, in order to study the large scale structure in the Universe, test and characterize cosmological models including Dark Energy. eROSITA is also expected to yield a sample of around 3 millions Active Galactic Nuclei, including both obscured and un-obscured objects, providing a unique view of the evolution of supermassive black holes within the emerging cosmic structure. The survey will also provide new insights into a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, including accreting binaries, active stars and diffuse emission within the Galaxy, as well as solar system bodies that emit X-rays via the charge exchange process. Finally, such a deep imaging survey at high spectral resolution, with its scanning strategy sensitive to a range of variability timescales from tens of seconds to years, will undoubtedly open up a vast discovery space for the study of rare, unpredicted, or unpredictable high-energy astrophysical phenomena. In this living document we present a comprehensive description of the main scientific goals of the mission, with strong emphasis on the early survey phases.},

  Abstract                 = {We use techniques from nonparametric function estimation theory to extract the density profiles, and their derivatives, from a set of N-body dark matter halos. We consider halos generated from LCDM simulations of gravitational clustering, as well as isolated, spherical collapses. The logarithmic density slopes gamma = d(log rho)/d(log r) of the LCDM halos are found to vary as power-laws in radius, reaching values of gamma ~ -1 at the innermost resolved radii (~0.01 r_virial). This behavior is significantly different from that of broken power-law models like the NFW profile, but similar to that of models like de Vaucouleurs'. Accordingly, we compare the N-body density profiles with various parametric models to find which provide the best fit. We consider an NFW-like model with arbitrary inner slope; Dehnen & McLaughlin's anisotropic model; Einasto's model (identical in functional form to Sersic's model but fit to the space density); and the density model of Prugniel & Simien that was designed to match the deprojected form of Sersic's R^{1/n} law. Overall, the best-fitting model to the LCDM halos is Einasto's, although the Prugniel-Simien and Dehnen-McLaughlin models also perform well. With regard to the spherical collapse halos, both the Prugniel-Simien and Einasto models describe the density profiles well, with an rms scatter some four times smaller than that obtained with either the NFW-like model or the 3-parameter Dehnen-McLaughlin model. Finally, we confirm recent claims of a systematic variation in profile shape with halo mass.},

  Abstract                 = {We present new improved constraints on the Hubble parameter H(z) in the redshift range 0.15 < z < 1.1, obtained from the differential spectroscopic evolution of early-type galaxies as a function of redshift. We extract a large sample of early-type galaxies ( ~ 11000) from several spectroscopic surveys, spanning almost 8 billion years of cosmic lookback time (0.15 < z < 1.42). We select the most massive, red elliptical galaxies, passively evolving and without signature of ongoing star formation. Those galaxies can be used as standard cosmic chronometers, as firstly proposed by Jimenez & Loeb (2002), whose differential age evolution as a function of cosmic time directly probes H(z). We analyze the 4000 Å break (D4000) as a function of redshift, use stellar population synthesis models to theoretically calibrate the dependence of the differential age evolution on the differential D4000, and estimate the Hubble parameter taking into account both statistical and systematical errors. We provide 8 new measurements of H(z) (see table 4), and determine its change in H(z) to a precision of 5-12% mapping homogeneously the redshift range up to z ~ 1.1; for the first time, we place a constraint on H(z) at z≠0 with a precision comparable with the one achieved for the Hubble constant (about 5-6% at z ~ 0.2), and covered a redshift range (0.5 < z < 0.8) which is crucial to distinguish many different quintessence cosmologies. These measurements have been tested to best match a ΛCDM model, clearly providing a statistically robust indication that the Universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion. This method shows the potentiality to open a new avenue in constrain a variety of alternative cosmologies, especially when future surveys (e.g. Euclid) will open the possibility to extend it up to z ~ 2.},

The heart of our approach is the construction of a suitable basis of plane waves which are eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator relative to the geometry of the curved space. These functions were previously introduced in the mathematical literature in the context of group theory; here we revisit and adapt the formalism in a way specific for quantum mechanics. Our developments render dealing with Lobatchevski spaces, which used to be quite difficult and a source of controversies, easily tractable. Applications to the Milne and de Sitter universes are discussed as examples.},

Here we study the consequences of taking the bounds on $\Omega_{0}$ given by inflationary models, i.e. $|\Omega_0 - 1| \ll 1$. We show that in this limit, a generic detectable non-flat manifold is locally indistinguishable from either a cylindrical ($R^2 \times S^1$) or toroidal ($R \times T^2$) manifold, irrespective of its global shape, with the former being more likely. Importantly this is compatible with some recent indications based on the analysis of high resolution CMB data. It also implies that in this limit an observer would not be able to distinguish topologically whether the universe is spherical, hyperbolic or flat. By severely restricting the expected topological signatures of detectable isometries, our results provide an effective theoretical framework for interpreting cosmological observations, and can be used to confine any parameter space which realistic search strategies, such as the `circles in the sky' method, need to concentrate on. This is particularly important in the inflationary limit, where the precise nature of cosmic topology becomes undecidable.},

Motivated by this, we make a systematic study of the necessary and sufficient conditions for undetectability as well as detectability (in principle) of cosmic topology (using pattern repetition) in presence of such uncertainties. We do this by developing two complementary methods to determine detectability for nearly flat universes. Using the first method we derive analytical conditions for undetectability for infinite redshift, the accuracy of which is then confirmed by the second method. Estimates based on WMAP data together with other measurements of the density parameters are used to illustrate both methods, which are shown to provide very similar results for high redshifts.},

  Abstract                 = {We present in a manifestly gauge-invariant form the theory of classical linear gravitational perturbations in part I, and a quantum theory of cosmological perturbations in part II. Part I includes applications to several important examples arising in cosmology: a univese dominated by hydrodynamical matter, a universe filled with scalar-field matter, and higher-derivative theories of gravity. The growth rates of perturbations are calculated analytically in most interesting cases. The analysis is applied to study the evolution of fluctuations in inflationary universe models. Part II includes a unified description of the quantum generation and evolution of inhomogeneities about a classial Friedmann background. The method is based on standard canonical quantization of the action for cosmological perturbations which has been reduced to an expression in terms of a single gauge-invariant variable. The spectrum of density perturbations originating in quantum fluctuations is calculated in universe with hydrodynamical matter, in inflationary universe models with scalar-field matter, and in higher-derivative theories of gravity. The gauge-invariant theory of classical and quantized cosmological perturbations developed in parts I and II is applied in part III to several interesting physical problems. It allows a simple derivation of the relation between temperature anistropes in the cosmic microwave background. radiation and the gauge-invariant potential for metric perturbations. The generation and evolution of gravitational waves is studied. As another example, a simple analysis of entropy perturbations and non-scale-invariant spectra in inflationary universe models is presented. The gauge-invariant theory of cosmological perturbations also allows a consistent and gauge-invariant definition of statistical fluctuations.},

  Abstract                 = {It is believed that soon after the Planck era, space-time should have a semiclassical nature. According to this, the escape from the general relativity theory is unavoidable. Two geometric counterterms are needed to regularize the divergences which come from the expected value. These counterterms are responsible for a higher derivative metric gravitation. Starobinsky's idea was that these higher derivatives could mimic a cosmological constant. In this work numerical solutions are considered for general Bianchi I anisotropic space-times in this higher derivative theory. The approach is ``experimental'' in the sense that there is no attempt for an analytical investigation of the results. It is shown that for zero cosmological constant Lambda=0, there are sets of initial conditions which form basins of attraction that asymptote Minkowski space. The complement of this set of initial conditions form basins which are attracted to some singular solutions. It is also shown, for a cosmological constant Lambda>0, that there are basins of attraction to a specific de Sitter solution. This result is consistent with Starobinsky's initial idea. The complement of this set also forms basins that are attracted to some type of singular solution. Because the singularity is characterized by curvature scalars, it must be stressed that the basin structure obtained is a topological invariant, i.e., coordinate independent.},

  Abstract                 = {Weak gravitational lensing is responsible for the shearing and magnification of the images of high-redshift sources due to the presence of intervening matter. The distortions are due to fluctuations in the gravitational potential, and are directly related to the distribution of matter and to the geometry and dynamics of the Universe. As a consequence, weak gravitational lensing offers unique possibilities for probing the Dark Matter and Dark Energy in the Universe. In this review, we summarise the theoretical and observational state of the subject, focussing on the statistical aspects of weak lensing, and consider the prospects for weak lensing surveys in the future. Weak gravitational lensing surveys are complementary to both galaxy surveys and cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations as they probe the unbiased non-linear matter power spectrum at modest redshifts. Most of the cosmological parameters are accurately estimated from CMB and large-scale galaxy surveys, so the focus of attention is shifting to understanding the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. On the theoretical side, recent advances in the use of 3D information of the sources from photometric redshifts promise greater statistical power, and these are further enhanced by the use of statistics beyond two-point quantities such as the power spectrum. The use of 3D information also alleviates difficulties arising from physical effects such as the intrinsic alignment of galaxies, which can mimic weak lensing to some extent. On the observational side, in the next few years weak lensing surveys such as CFHTLS, VST-KIDS and Pan-STARRS, and the planned Dark Energy Survey, will provide the first weak lensing surveys covering very large sky areas and depth. In the long run even more ambitious programmes such as DUNE, the Supernova Anisotropy Probe (SNAP) and Large-aperture Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) are planned. Weak lensing of diffuse components such as the CMB and 21 cm emission can also provide valuable cosmological information. Finally, we consider the prospects for joint analysis with other probes, such as (1) the CMB to probe background cosmology (2) galaxy surveys to probe large-scale bias and (3) Sunyaev Zeldovich surveys to study small-scale baryonic physics, and consider the lensing effect on cosmological supernova observations.},

  Abstract                 = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

Dynamical systems theory, in conjunction with the orthonormal frame approach, has proved to be an invaluable tool for analyzing spatially homogeneous cosmologies. It is thus natural to use such techniques to study the geodesics of these models. We therefore augment the Einstein field equations with the geodesic equations, all written in dimensionless form, obtaining an extended system of first-order ordinary differential equations that simultaneously describes the evolution of the gravitational field and the behavior of the associated geodesics. It is shown that the extended system is a powerful tool for investigating the effect of spacetime anisotropies on the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, and that it can also be used for studying geodesic chaos.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a test of different error estimators for two-point clustering statistics, appropriate for present and future large galaxy redshift surveys. Using an ensemble of very large dark matter CDM N-body simulations, we compare internal error estimators (jackknife and bootstrap) to external ones (Monte Carlo realizations). For three-dimensional clustering statistics, we find that none of the internal error methods investigated is able to reproduce either accurately or robustly the errors of external estimators on 1 to 25h-1Mpc scales. The standard bootstrap overestimates the variance of (s) by ~40 per cent on all scales probed, but recovers, in a robust fashion, the principal eigenvectors of the underlying covariance matrix. The jackknife returns the correct variance on large scales, but significantly overestimates it on smaller scales. This scale dependence in the jackknife affects the recovered eigenvectors, which tend to disagree on small scales with the external estimates. Our results have important implications for fitting models to galaxy clustering measurements. For example, in a two-parameter fit to the projected correlation function, we find that the standard bootstrap systematically overestimates the 95 per cent confidence interval, while the jackknife method remains biased, but to a lesser extent. Ignoring the systematic bias, the scatter between realizations, for Gaussian statistics, implies that a 2 confidence interval, as inferred from an internal estimator, corresponds in practice to anything from 1 to 3. By oversampling the subvolumes, we find that it is possible, at least for the cases we consider, to obtain robust bootstrap variances and confidence intervals that agree with external error estimates. Our results are applicable to two-point statistics, like (s) and wp(rp), measured in large redshift surveys, and show that the interpretation of clustering measurements with internally estimated errors should be treated with caution.},

  Abstract                 = {A nonsingular cosmological scenario is presented in which the currently observed Riemannian configuration of spacetime originates from a primordial Weylian "stiff matter" phase driven by a geometrized inflaton-like field. In the particular case of a Friedman-Robertson-Walker line element, it is shown that an unstable original Minkowski vacuum starts to collapse adiabatically at a remote past and bounces when a minimum radius is attained. Throughout the collapsing stage, this matter-free Universe is accelerated (or "inflationary"). As in models of spontaneous quantum creation, the bouncing phase can be shown to correspond to the propagation of a Weyl instanton in an Euclideanized, classically forbidden region. In the course of the bouncing period, concurrent to the maximal deviation of the Riemannian configuration, a geometry-driven amplification mechanism operates causing the exponential increase of entropy and matter fluctuations. Once the environment temperature is always bounded, this nonadiabatical process stands for a "Big -- but finite -- Bang" creation event, followed by a standard radiation-dominated era. The model describes an eternal, Friedman-like open Universe, free of many problems that hinder standard cosmology; the observed existence of a baryon excess also fits naturally within the proposed scheme.},

That is, we do not consider rotational or gravitational wave contributions to the perturbations. We show that the electric part of the Weyl conformal tensor E and the shear \Sigma constitute the two basic perturbed variables in terms of which all remaining observable quantities can be described. Einstein's equations of general relativity reduce to a closed set of dynamical systems for E and \Sigma. The basis for a gauge-invariant Hamiltonian treatment of the perturbation theory in the FRW background is then set up.},

A method which involved only observable, gauge-independent perturbed quantities, considered in the framework of quasi-Maxwellian equations of gravitation, was derived. This method made it possible to obtain a Hamiltonian treatment of the perturbed FRW cosmology without the entailed ambiguities regarding gauge choices. Now we carry this Hamiltonian treatment to its full extent by advancing one step further in order to perform the quantization of all three perturbation types. This is done by following the standard semiclassical procedure and employing the quantum optics formalism to solve the Schro¨dinger equation and obtain all relevant quantities in this framework.},

This model is important because it demonstrates that quantum effects can lead to violations of the weak energy condition on cosmological scales - on average, not just in fluctuations - although the effect in this particular model is far too small to be observed. The revision consists of modifying the propagator so that dimensional regularization can be used when the dimension of the renormalized theory is not four. Although the finite part of the stress-energy tensor does not change (in D=4) from our previous result, the counterterms do. We also speculate that a certain, finite and separately conserved part of the stress tensor can be subsumed into a natural correction of the initial state from free Bunch-Davies vacuum.},

We then employ it to compute the fully renormalized stress tensor at one and two loop orders for a massless, minimally coupled phi^4 theory which is released in Bunch-Davies vacuum at t=0 in co-moving coordinates. In this system the uncertainty principle elevates the scalar above the minimum of its potential, resulting in a phase of super-acceleration. With the non-derivative self-interaction the scalar's breaking of de Sitter invariance becomes observable. It is also worth noting that the weak energy condition is violated on cosmological scales. An interesting subsidiary result is that canceling overlapping divergences in the stress tensor requires a conformal counterterm which has no effect on purely scalar diagrams.},

  Abstract                 = {Photometric redshift (photo-z) estimates are playing an increasingly important role in extragalactic astronomy and cosmology. Crucial to many photo-z applications is the accurate quantification of photometric redshift errors and their distributions, including identification of likely catastrophic failures in photo-z estimates. We consider several methods of estimating photo-z errors and propose new training-set based error estimators based on spectroscopic training set data. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and simulations of the Dark Energy Survey as examples, we show that this method provides a robust, relatively unbiased estimate of photo-z errors. We show that culling objects with large, accurately estimated photo-z errors from a sample can reduce the incidence of catastrophic photo-z failures.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the first application to density field reconstruction to a galaxy survey to undo the smoothing of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature due to non-linear gravitational evolution and thereby improve the precision of the distance measurements possible. We apply the reconstruction technique to the clustering of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample, sharpening the BAO feature and achieving a 1.9 per cent measurement of the distance to z = 0.35. We update the reconstruction algorithm of Eisenstein et al. to account for the effects of survey geometry as well as redshift-space distortions and validate it on 160 LasDamas simulations. We demonstrate that reconstruction sharpens the BAO feature in the angle averaged galaxy correlation function, reducing the non-linear smoothing scale Σnl from 8.1 to 4.4 Mpc h-1. Reconstruction also significantly reduces the effects of redshift-space distortions at the BAO scale, isotropizing the correlation function. This sharpened BAO feature yields an unbiased distance estimate (<0.2 per cent) and reduces the scatter from 3.3 to 2.1 per cent. We demonstrate the robustness of these results to the various reconstruction parameters, including the smoothing scale, the galaxy bias and the linear growth rate. Applying this reconstruction algorithm to the SDSS LRG DR7 sample improves the significance of the BAO feature in these data from 3.3σ for the unreconstructed correlation function to 4.2σ after reconstruction. We estimate a relative distance scale DV/rs to z = 0.35 of 8.88 ± 0.17, where rs is the sound horizon and DV≡(DA2H-1)1/3 is a combination of the angular diameter distance DA and Hubble parameter H. Assuming a sound horizon of 154.25 Mpc, this translates into a distance measurement DV(z = 0.35) = 1.356 ± 0.025 Gpc. We find that reconstruction reduces the distance error in the DR7 sample from 3.5 to 1.9 per cent, equivalent to a survey with three times the volume of SDSS.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent cosmological observations suggest the existence of a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$ with the magnitude $\Lambda(G\hbar/c^3) \approx 10^{-123}$. This review discusses several aspects of the cosmological constant both from the cosmological (sections 1-6) and field theoretical (sections 7-11) perspectives. The first section introduces the key issues related to cosmological constant and provides a brief historical overview. This is followed by a summary of the kinematics and dynamics of the standard Friedmann model of the universe paying special attention to features involving the cosmological constant. Section 3 reviews the observational evidence for cosmological constant, especially the supernova results, constraints from the age of the universe and a few others. Theoretical models (quintessence, tachyonic scalar field, ...) with evolving cosmological `constant' are described from different perspectives in the next section. Constraints on dark energy from structure formation and from CMBR anisotropies are discussed in the next two sections. The latter part of the review (sections 7-11) concentrates on more conceptual and fundamental aspects of the cosmological constant. Section 7 provides some alternative interpretations of the cosmological constant which could have a bearing on the possible solution to the problem. Several relaxation mechanisms have been suggested in the literature to reduce the cosmological constant to the currently observed value and some of these attempts are described in section 8. Next section gives a brief description of the geometrical structure of the de Sitter spacetime and the thermodynamics of the de Sitter universe is taken up in section 10. The last section deals with the role of string theory in the cosmological constant problem.},

  Abstract                 = {Physics invites the idea that space contains energy whose gravitational effect approximates that of Einstein's cosmological constant, Lambda; nowadays the concept is termed dark energy or quintessence. Physics also suggests the dark energy could be dynamical, allowing the arguably appealing picture that the dark energy density is evolving to its natural value, zero, and is small now because the expanding universe is old. This alleviates the classical problem of the curious energy scale of order a millielectronvolt associated with a constant Lambda. Dark energy may have been detected by recent advances in the cosmological tests. The tests establish a good scientific case for the context, in the relativistic Friedmann-Lemaitre model, including the gravitational inverse square law applied to the scales of cosmology. We have well-checked evidence that the mean mass density is not much more than one quarter of the critical Einstein-de Sitter value. The case for detection of dark energy is serious but not yet as convincing; we await more checks that may come out of work in progress. Planned observations might be capable of detecting evolution of the dark energy density; a positive result would be a considerable stimulus to attempts to understand the microphysics of dark energy. This review presents the basic physics and astronomy of the subject, reviews the history of ideas, assesses the state of the observational evidence, and comments on recent developments in the search for a fundamental theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) surveys are promising probes of cosmology — in particular for Dark Energy (DE) —, given their ability to find distant clusters and provide estimates for their mass. However, current SZ catalogs contain tens to hundreds of objects and maximum likelihood estimators may present biases for such sample sizes. In this work we study estimators from cluster abundance for some cosmological parameters, in particular the DE equation of state parameter w0, the amplitude of density fluctuations σ8, and the Dark Matter density parameter Ωc. We begin by deriving an unbinned likelihood for cluster number counts, showing that it is equivalent to the one commonly used in the literature. We use the Monte Carlo approach to determine the presence of bias using this likelihood and study its behavior with both the area and depth of the survey, and the number of cosmological parameters fitted. Our fiducial models are based on the South Pole Telescope (SPT) SZ survey. Assuming perfect knowledge of mass and redshift some estimators have non-negligible biases. For example, the bias of σ8 corresponds to about 40% of its statistical error bar when fitted together with Ωc and w0. Including a SZ mass-observable relation decreases the relevance of the bias, for the typical sizes of current SZ surveys. Considering a joint likelihood for cluster abundance and the so-called ``distance priors'', we obtain that the biases are negligible compared to the statistical errors. However, we show that the biases from SZ estimators do not go away with increasing sample sizes and they may become the dominant source of error for an all sky survey at the SPT sensitivity. Finally, we compute the confidence regions for the cosmological parameters using Fisher matrix and profile likelihood approaches, showing that they are compatible with the Monte Carlo ones. The results of this work validate the use of the current maximum likelihood methods for present SZ surveys, but highlight the need for further studies for upcoming experiments. To perform the analyses of this work, we developed fast, accurate, and adaptable codes for cluster counts in the framework of the Numerical Cosmology Library.},

This excess temperature is, within the limits of our observations, isotropic, unpolarized, and free from seasonal variations (July, 1964 - April, 1965).

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a method to constrain general cosmological models using Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) distance measurements from galaxy samples covering different redshift ranges, and apply this method to analyse samples drawn from the SDSS and 2dFGRS. BAO are detected in the clustering of the combined 2dFGRS and SDSS main galaxy samples, and measure the distance--redshift relation at z=0.2. BAO in the clustering of the SDSS luminous red galaxies measure the distance--redshift relation at z=0.35. The observed scale of the BAO calculated from these samples and from the combined sample are jointly analysed using estimates of the correlated errors, to constrain the form of the distance measure D_V(z)=[(1+z)^2D_A^2cz/H(z)]^(1/3). Here D_A is the angular diameter distance, and H(z) is the Hubble parameter. This gives r_s/D_V(0.2)=0.1980+/-0.0058 and r_s/D_V(0.35)=0.1094+/-0.0033 (1sigma errors), with correlation coefficient of 0.39, where r_s is the comoving sound horizon scale at recombination. Matching the BAO to have the same measured scale at all redshifts then gives D_V(0.35)/D_V(0.2)=1.812+/-0.060. The recovered ratio is roughly consistent with that predicted by the higher redshift SNLS supernovae data for Lambda cosmologies, but does require slightly stronger cosmological acceleration at low redshift. If we force the cosmological model to be flat with constant w, then we find Om_m=0.249+/-0.018 and w=-1.004+/-0.089 after combining with the SNLS data, and including the WMAP measurement of the apparent acoustic horizon angle in the CMB.},

  Abstract                 = {The spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) galaxy sample represents the final set of galaxies observed using the original SDSS target selection criteria. We analyse the clustering of galaxies within this sample, including both the luminous red galaxy and main samples, and also include the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey data. In total, this sample comprises 893319 galaxies over 9100deg2. Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are observed in power spectra measured for different slices in redshift; this allows us to constrain the distance-redshift relation at multiple epochs. We achieve a distance measure at redshift z = 0.275, of rs(zd)/DV(0.275) = 0.1390 +/- 0.0037 (2.7 per cent accuracy), where rs(zd) is the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, DV(z) == [(1 + z)2D2Acz/H(z)]1/3, DA(z) is the angular diameter distance and H(z) is the Hubble parameter. We find an almost independent constraint on the ratio of distances DV(0.35)/DV(0.2) = 1.736 +/- 0.065, which is consistent at the 1.1sigma level with the best-fitting Lambda cold dark matter model obtained when combining our z = 0.275 distance constraint with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 5-year (WMAP5) data. The offset is similar to that found in previous analyses of the SDSS DR5 sample, but the discrepancy is now of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and a change in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. Using WMAP5 constraints on Omegabh2 and Omegach2, and combining our BAO distance measurements with those from the Union supernova sample, places a tight constraint on Omegam = 0.286 +/- 0.018 and H0 = 68.2 +/- 2.2kms-1Mpc-1 that is robust to allowing Omegak != 0 and w != -1. This result is independent of the behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by the BAO and supernova measurements. Combining these data sets with the full WMAP5 likelihood constraints provides tight constraints on both Omegak = -0.006 +/- 0.008 and w = -0.97 +/- 0.10 for a constant dark energy equation of state.},

The magnitude-redshift data for these SNe, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fit jointly with a set of SNe from the Calan/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All SN peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia lightcurve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8 Omega_M - 0.6 Omega_Lambda ~= -0.2 +/- 0.1 in the region of interest (Omega_M <~ 1.5). For a flat (Omega_M + Omega_Lambda = 1) cosmology we find Omega_M = 0.28{+0.09,-0.08} (1 sigma statistical) {+0.05,-0.04} (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Lambda = 0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Lambda = 0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is non-zero and positive, with a confidence of P(Lambda > 0) = 99\%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is t_0 = 14.9{+1.4,-1.1} (0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Calan/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. The conclusions are robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the SN peak magnitudes.},

This makes it possible to analyse the quantum evolution of the perturbations since their dynamics depends only on this classical background. In this paper, we show that this simple Hamiltonian can also be obtained from the Einstein--Hilbert Lagrangian without making use of any assumption about the dynamics of the background metric. In particular, it can be used in situations where the background metric is also quantized, hence providing a substantial simplification over the direct approach originally developed by Halliwell and Hawking.},

We find a very slightly blue spectrum ($n_{\mathrm{S}}-1>0$). Taking into account the spectral index constraint as well as the CMB normalization measure yields an equation of state that should be less than $\omega\lesssim 8\times 10^{-4}$, implying $n_{\mathrm{S}}-1 \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, and that the characteristic size of the Universe at the bounce is $L_0 \sim 10^3 \ell_\mathrm{Planck}$, a region where one expects that the Wheeler-DeWitt equation should be valid without being spoiled by string or loop quantum gravity effects.},

In this scenario, one can find new ways to solve the standard cosmological puzzles. One can also obtain scale invariant spectra for both scalar and tensor perturbations: this will be the case, for instance, if the contracting Universe is dust-dominated at the time at which large wavelength perturbations get larger than the curvature scale. We present a particular example based on a dust fluid classically contracting model, where a bounce occurs due to quantum effects, in which these features are explicit.},

We perform a Fisher matrix analysis based on cluster number counts in combination with estimates of the 2-point cluster correlation function. The effect of the survey design is implemented through an observationally well tested cluster selection function. Special attention is given to the modelling of the shot noise and sample variance, which we estimate by applying our selection function to numerically simulated surveys. We then infer the constraints on the equation of state of the dark energy considering various survey configurations. We quantitatively investigate the respective impact of the cluster mass measurements, of the correlation function and of the 1<z<2 cluster population. We show that, with some 20 Ms XMM observing time, it is possible to constrain the dark energy parameters at a level which is comparable to that expected from the next generation of cosmic probes. Such a survey has also the power to provide unique insights into the physics of high redshift clusters and AGN properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Starting in late 2013, the eRosita telescope will survey the X-ray sky with unprecedented sensitivity. Assuming a detection limit of 50 photons in the (0.5-2.0) keV energy band with a typical exposure time of 1.6 ks, we predict that eRosita will detect ˜9.3 × 104 clusters of galaxies more massive than 5 × 1013 h-1 M⊙, with the currently planned all-sky survey. Their median redshift will be z≃ 0.35. We perform a Fisher-matrix analysis to forecast the constraining power of ? on the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology and, simultaneously, on the X-ray scaling relations for galaxy clusters. Special attention is devoted to the possibility of detecting primordial non-Gaussianity. We consider two experimental probes: the number counts and the angular clustering of a photon-count limited sample of clusters. We discuss how the cluster sample should be split to optimize the analysis and we show that redshift information of the individual clusters is vital to break the strong degeneracies among the model parameters. For example, performing a 'tomographic' analysis based on photometric-redshift estimates and combining one- and two-point statistics will give marginal 1σ errors of Δσ8≃ 0.036 and ΔΩm≃ 0.012 without priors, and improve the current estimates on the slope of the luminosity-mass relation by a factor of 3. Regarding primordial non-Gaussianity, ? clusters alone will give ΔfNL≃ 9, 36 and 144 for the local, orthogonal and equilateral model, respectively. Measuring redshifts with spectroscopic accuracy would further tighten the constraints by nearly 40 per cent (barring fNL which displays smaller improvements). Finally, combining ? data with the analysis of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background by the Planck satellite should give sensational constraints on both the cosmology and the properties of the intracluster medium.},

D 62 (2000) 83507], solutions of this model were constructed as Gaussian superpositions of negative and positive modes solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, and quantum Bohmian trajectories were obtained in the framework of the Bohm-de Broglie (BdB) interpretation of quantum cosmology. In the present Letter, we analyze the quantum Bohmian trajectories of a different class of Gaussian packets. We are able to show that this new class generates Bohmian trajectories which begin classical (with decelerated expansion), undergo an accelerated expansion in the middle of its evolution due to the presence of quantum cosmological effects in this period, and return to its classical decelerated expansion in the far future. We also show that the relation between luminosity distance and redshift in the quantum cosmological model can be made close to the corresponding relation coming from the classical model supplemented by a cosmological constant, for /z<1. These results suggest the possibility of interpreting the present observations of high redshift supernovae as the manifestation of a quantum cosmological effect.},

The Liouville operator which describes the free streaming of electrons, and the collision term which describes the scattering of photons on free electrons are computed up to second order. Finally, the remaining dependence in the direction of the photon momentum is handled by expanding in projected symmetric trace-free multipoles and also in the more commonly used normal modes components. The results obtained remain to be used for computing numerically the contribution in the cosmic microwave background bi-spectrum which arises from the evolution of second-order perturbations, in order to disentangle the primordial non-Gaussianity from the one generated by the subsequent nonlinear evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {On the arcminute angular scales probed by Planck, the CMB anisotropies are gently perturbed by gravitational lensing. Here we present a detailed study of this effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217GHz frequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. We use the temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a (noisy) map of the CMB lensing potential, which provides an integrated measure of the mass distribution back to the CMB last-scattering surface. Our lensing potential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a fact which we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scale structure. We estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, finding generally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting LCDM model for the Planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100 correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structures which source the lensing potential. When combined with the temperature power spectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameter constraints; it improves CMB-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of two and also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordial perturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing a measurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent of large-scale polarization data. Discarding scale information, our measurement corresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential power spectrum, or a 2% constraint on the RMS amplitude of matter fluctuations at z~2.},

  Abstract                 = {We present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as a function of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the Planck SZ (PSZ) catalogue. The PSZ is selected through the signature of the Sunyaev--Zeldovich (SZ) effect, and the sub-sample used here has a signal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster and all but one with a redshift estimate. We discuss the completeness of the sample and our construction of a likelihood analysis. Using a relation between mass $M$ and SZ signal $Y$ calibrated to X-ray measurements, we derive constraints on the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We test the robustness of our estimates and find that possible biases in the $Y$--$M$ relation and the halo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from the cluster sample. Assuming the X-ray determined mass to be biased low relative to the true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observed mass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we find that $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and $\sigma_8(\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. The value of $\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a value of 20% we find $\sigma_8(\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and a tighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. We find that the larger values of $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by Planck's measurements of the primary CMB anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass bias of about 40%. Alternatively, consistency with the primary CMB constraints can be achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scales relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model, such as a component of massive neutrinos (abridged).},

  Abstract                 = {We present the Planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of the two-point correlation function of the CMB temperature fluctuations. We use this likelihood to derive the Planck CMB power spectrum over three decades in l, covering 2 <= l <= 2500. The main source of error at l <= 1500 is cosmic variance. Uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumental noise dominate the error budget at higher l's. For l < 50, our likelihood exploits all Planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 GHz through a physically motivated Bayesian component separation technique. At l >= 50, we employ a correlated Gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectra derived from the 100, 143 and 217 GHz channels. We validate our likelihood through an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact of residual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters. We find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residuals of a few uK^2 at l <= 1000. We compare our results with foreground-cleaned CMB maps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 GHz Planck map, and find broad agreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. The best-fit LCDM cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary Planck polarisation spectra. The standard LCDM cosmology is well constrained by Planck by l <= 1500. For example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1. Considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indication of significant departures from the LCDM framework. Finally, we report a tension between the best-fit LCDM model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a power deficit of 5-10% at l <~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. We do not elaborate further on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our most puzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset. (Abridged)},

We use Omega_m*h and f_b = Omega_b/Omega_m to describe the shape of the power spectrum, sigma8 for the (linearly extrapolated) normalization, and beta to parametrize linear theory redshift space distortions. On scales k < 0.16 h/Mpc, our maximum likelihood values are Omega_m*h = 0.264 +/-0.043, f_b = 0.286 +/- 0.065, sigma8 = 0.966 +/- 0.048, and beta = 0.45 +/- 0.12. When we take a prior on Omega_b from WMAP, we find Omega_m*h = 0.207 +/- 0.030, which is in excellent agreement with WMAP and 2dF. This indicates that we have reasonably measured the gross shape of the power spectrum but we have difficulty breaking the degeneracy between Omega_m*h and f_b because the baryon oscillations are not resolved in the current spectroscopic survey window function.},

  Abstract                 = {Null Energy Condition (NEC) requires the equation of state (EoS) of the universe $w_u$ satisfy $w_u\geq-1$, which implies, for instance in a universe with matter and dark energy dominating $w_u=w_m\Omega_m+w_{de}\Omega_{de}=w_{de}\Omega_{de}\geq-1$. In this paper we study constraints on the dark energy models from the requirement of the NEC. We will show that with $\Omega_{de}\sim0.7$, $w_{de}<-1$ at present epoch is possible. However, NEC excludes the possibility of $w_{de}<-1$ forever as happened in the Phantom model, but if $w_{de}<-1$ stays for a short period of time as predicted in the Quintom theory NEC can be satisfied. We take three examples of Quintom models of dark energy, namely the phenomenological EoS, the two-scalar-field model and the single scalar model with a modified Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) lagrangian to show how this happens.},

  Abstract                 = {We present and employ a new kinematical approach to cosmological `dark energy' studies. We construct models in terms of the dimensionless second and third derivatives of the scale factor a(t) with respect to cosmic time t, namely the present-day value of the deceleration parameter q_0 and the cosmic jerk parameter, j(t). An elegant feature of this parameterization is that all LCDM models have j(t)=1 (constant), which facilitates simple tests for departures from the LCDM paradigm. Applying our model to the three best available sets of redshift-independent distance measurements, from type Ia supernovae and X-ray cluster gas mass fraction measurements, we obtain clear statistical evidence for a late time transition from a decelerating to an accelerating phase. For a flat model with constant jerk, j(t)=j, we measure q_0=-0.81+-0.14 and j=2.16+0.81-0.75, results that are consistent with LCDM at about the 1sigma confidence level. A standard `dynamical' analysis of the same data, employing the Friedmann equations and modeling the dark energy as a fluid with an equation of state parameter, w (constant), gives Omega_m=0.306+0.042-0.040 and w=-1.15+0.14-0.18, also consistent with LCDM at about the 1sigma level. In comparison to dynamical analyses, the kinematical approach uses a different model set and employs a minimum of prior information, being independent of any particular gravity theory. The results obtained with this new approach therefore provide important additional information and we argue that both kinematical and dynamical techniques should be employed in future dark energy studies, where possible. Our results provide further interesting support for the concordance LCDM paradigm.},

While geometry is a local characteristic that gives the intrinsic curvature, topology is a global feature that characterizes the shape and size of the 3-space. The geometry constrains, but does not dictate the the spatial topology. We show that, besides determining the spatial geometry, the knowledge of the spatial topology allows to place tight constraints on the density parameters associated with dark matter ($\Omega_m$) and dark energy ($\Omega_{\Lambda}$). By using the Poincar\'e dodecahedral space as the observable spatial topology, we reanalyze the current type Ia supenovae (SNe Ia) constraints on the density parametric space $\Omega_{m} - \Omega_{\Lambda}$. From this SNe Ia plus cosmic topology analysis, we found best fit values for the density parameters, which are in agreement with a number of independent cosmological observations.},

This cosmic-shear technique is based on the measurement of the weak distortions that lensing induces in the shape of background galaxies as photons travel through large-scale structures. This technique is now widely used to measure the mass distribution of galaxy clusters and has recently been detected in random regions of the sky. In this review, we present the theory and observational status of cosmic shear. We describe the principles of weak lensing and the predictions for the shear statistics in favored cosmological models. Next, we review the current measurements of cosmic shear and show how they constrain cosmological parameters. We then describe the prospects offered by upcoming and future cosmic-shear surveys as well as the technical challenges that have to be met for the promises of cosmic shear to be fully realized.},

  Abstract                 = {Quartessence is one of the alternatives to LambdaCDM that has lately attracted considerable interest. According to this unifying dark matter/energy scenario, the Universe evolved from an early nonrelativistic matter-dominated phase to a more recent accelerated expansion phase, driven by a single fluid component. Recently, it has been shown that some problems of the quartessence model, such as the existence of instabilities and oscillations in the matter power spectrum, can be avoided if a specific type of intrinsic entropy perturbation is considered. In the present article we explore the role of skewness in constraining this nonadiabatic scenario. We show that nonadiabatic quartessence and quintessence have different signatures for the skewness of the density distribution on large scales and suggest that this quantity might prove helpful to break possible degeneracies between them.},

  Abstract                 = {The possibility of unifying dark matter and dark energy has recently attracted considerable interest. In this so called quartessence scenario, a single component is responsible for both the clustering of matter and the accelerated expansion of the universe. A model archetype for such scenario is provided by the Chaplygin gas. Although this model is in agreement with the data on the expansion history, problems arise in the power spectrum of density fluctuations for adiabatic perturbations. In this contribution we consider other quartessence models and confirm that instabilities and oscillations in the matter power spectrum are a characteristic of more generic quartessence models, namely those with a convex equation of state. We show that, as in the Chaplygin case, this kind of problem can be solved by considering intrinsic non-adiabatic perturbations such that, as an initial condition, the perturbed fluid is gradient pressure free. We also discuss how the problems of adiabatic quartessence can be circumvented by other types of equations of state.},

  Abstract                 = {We present observations of 10 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 0.16 < z < 0.62. With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the cosmological constant (Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\% to 15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega_Lambda > 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 < 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M > 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q_0 <0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda >0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega_Lambda>0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega_M+Omega_Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega_Lambda >0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega_Lambda=0 and q_0 > 0.},

  Abstract                 = {We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to determine the Hubble constant from optical and infrared observations of over 600 Cepheid variables in the host galaxies of eight recent Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), providing the calibration for a magnitude-redshift relation based on 253 SNe Ia. Increased precision over past measurements of the Hubble constant comes from five improvements: (1) more than doubling the number of infrared observations of Cepheids in the nearby SN hosts; (2) increasing the sample size of ideal SN Ia calibrators from six to eight; (3) increasing by 20% the number of Cepheids with infrared observations in the megamaser host NGC 4258 (4) reducing the difference in the mean metallicity of the Cepheid comparison samples between NGC 4258 and the SN hosts from Δlog [O/H] = 0.08 to 0.05; and (5) calibrating all optical Cepheid colors with a single camera, WFC3, to remove cross-instrument zero-point errors. The result is a reduction in the uncertainty in H 0 due to steps beyond the first rung of the distance ladder from 3.5% to 2.3%. The measurement of H 0 via the geometric distance to NGC 4258 is 74.8 ± 3.1 km s-1 Mpc-1, a 4.1% measurement including systematic uncertainties. Better precision independent of the distance to NGC 4258 comes from the use of two alternative Cepheid absolute calibrations: (1) 13 Milky Way Cepheids with trigonometric parallaxes measured with HST/fine guidance sensor and Hipparcos and (2) 92 Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud for which multiple accurate and precise eclipsing binary distances are available, yielding 74.4 ± 2.5 km s-1 Mpc-1, a 3.4% uncertainty including systematics. Our best estimate uses all three calibrations but a larger uncertainty afforded from any two: H 0 = 73.8 ± 2.4 km s-1 Mpc-1 including systematic errors, corresponding to a 3.3% uncertainty. The improved measurement of H 0, when combined with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 7 year data, results in a tighter constraint on the equation-of-state parameter of dark energy of w = -1.08 ± 0.10. It also rules out the best-fitting gigaparsec-scale void models, posited as an alternative to dark energy. The combined H 0 + WMAP results yield N eff = 4.2 ± 0.7 for the number of relativistic particle species in the early universe, a low-significance excess for the value expected from the three known neutrino flavors.

These objects, which include 13 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia at z > 1, were discovered during 14 epochs of reimaging of the GOODS fields North and South over two years with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on HST. Together with a recalibration of our previous HST-discovered SNe Ia, the full sample of 23 SNe Ia at z > 1 provides the highest-redshift sample known. Combined with previous SN Ia datasets, we measured H(z) at discrete, uncorrelated epochs, reducing the uncertainty of H(z>1) from 50\% to under 20\%, strengthening the evidence for a cosmic jerk--the transition from deceleration in the past to acceleration in the present. The unique leverage of the HST high-redshift SNe Ia provides the first meaningful constraint on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter at z >1. The result remains consistent with a cosmological constant (w(z)=-1), and rules out rapidly evolving dark energy (dw/dz >>1). The defining property of dark energy, its negative pressure, appears to be present at z>1, in the epoch preceding acceleration, with ~98\% confidence in our primary fit. Moreover, the z>1 sample-averaged spectral energy distribution is consistent with that of the typical SN Ia over the last 10 Gyr, indicating that any spectral evolution of the properties of SNe Ia with redshift is still below our detection threshold.},

The luminosity distances to these and 170 previous SNe Ia are provided. A purely kinematic interpretation of the SN Ia sample provides evidence at the > 99\% confidence level for a transition from deceleration to acceleration or similarly, strong evidence for a cosmic jerk. Using a simple model of the expansion history, the transition between the two epochs is constrained to be at z=0.46 +/- 0.13. The data are consistent with the cosmic concordance model of Omega_M ~ 0.3, Omega_Lambda~0.7 (chi^2_dof=1.06), and are inconsistent with a simple model of evolution or dust as an alternative to dark energy. For a flat Universe with a cosmological constant. When combined with external flat-Universe constraints we find w=-1.02 + 0.13 - 0.19 (and $<-0.76 at the 95\% confidence level) for an assumed static equation of state of dark energy, P = w\rho c^2. Joint constraints on both the recent equation of state of dark energy, $w_0$, and its time evolution, dw/dz, are a factor of ~8 more precise than its first estimate and twice as precise as those without the SNe Ia discovered with HST. Our constraints are consistent with the static nature of and value of w expected for a cosmological constant (i.e., w_0 = -1.0, dw/dz = 0), and are inconsistent with very rapid evolution of dark energy.

We use the caustic technique to remove foreground and background galaxies. The cluster virial mass function agrees well with recent estimates from both X-ray observations and cluster richnesses. The mass function lies between those predicted by the First-Year and Three-Year WMAP data. We constrain the cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ and find good agreement with WMAP and constraints from other techniques. With the CIRS mass function alone, we estimate $\Omega_m=0.24^{+0.14}_{-0.09}$ and $\sigma_8=0.92^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$, or $\sigma_8=0.84\pm$0.03 when holding $\Omega_m=0.3$ fixed. We also use the WMAP parameters as priors and constrain velocity segregation in clusters. Using the First and Third-Year results, we infer velocity segregation of $\sigma_{gxy}/\sigma_DM\approx0.94\pm$0.05 or 1.28$\pm$0.06 respectively. We compare the velocity dispersion function of clusters to that of early-type galaxies and conclude that clusters comprise the high-velocity end of the velocity dispersion function of dark matter haloes. The evolution of cluster abundances provides constraints on dark energy models; the mass function presented here offers an important low redshift calibration benchmark.},

  Abstract                 = {We create a sample of spectroscopically identified galaxies with $z < 0.2$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7, covering 6813 deg$^2$. Galaxies are chosen to sample the highest mass haloes, with an effective bias of 1.5, allowing us to construct 1000 mock galaxy catalogs (described in Paper II), which we use to estimate statistical errors and test our methods. We use an estimate of the gravitational potential to "reconstruct" the linear density fluctuations, enhancing the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal in the measured correlation function and power spectrum. Fitting to these measurements, we determine $D_{V}(z_{\rm eff}=0.15) = (664\pm25)(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ Mpc; this is a better than 4 per cent distance measurement. This "fills the gap" in BAO distance ladder between previously measured local and higher redshift measurements, and affords significant improvement in constraining the properties of dark energy. Combining our measurement with other BAO measurements from BOSS and 6dFGS galaxy samples provides a 15 per cent improvement in the determination of the equation of state of dark energy and the value of the Hubble parameter at $z=0$ ($H_0$). Our measurement is fully consistent with the Planck results and the $\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmology, but increases the tension between Planck$+$BAO $H_0$ determinations and direct $H_0$ measurements.},

After accounting for systematic errors and allowing for property covariance, we find that scaling relations derived from optical and X-ray selected cluster samples are consistent with one another. Moreover, these cluster scaling relations satisfy several non-trivial spatial abundance constraints and closure relations. Given the good agreement between optical and X-ray samples, we combine the two and derive a joint set of LX-M and YSZ-M relations. Our best-fitting YSZ-M relation is in good agreement with the observed amplitude of the thermal SZ power spectrum for a Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 cosmology, and is consistent with the masses for the two CLASH galaxy clusters published thus far. We predict the halo masses of the remaining z ≤ 0.4 CLASH clusters, and use our scaling relations to compare our results with a variety of X-ray and weak lensing cluster masses from the literature.},

Off-diagonal elements due to scatter in the mass-tracer scaling with mass are included, as are observational effects such as biases/scatter in the data, detection rates (completeness), and false detections (purity). We apply the formalism to a hypothetical volume limited optical survey where the cluster mass-tracer is chosen to be the number of satellite galaxies assigned to a cluster. Such a survey can strongly constrain 8 (8 ~0.05), the power law index where <Ngal|m>=(m/M1) (~0.03), and perhaps even the Hubble parameter (h ~ 0.07). We find cluster abundances and bias are not well suited for constraining m or the amplitude M1. We also find that without bias information 8 and are degenerate, implying constraints on the former are strongly dependent on priors used for the latter and vice-versa. The degeneracy stems from an intrinsic scaling relation of the halo mass function, and hence it should be present regardless of the mass-tracer used in the survey.},

  Abstract                 = {Minimizing the scatter between cluster mass and accessible observables is an important goal for cluster cosmology. In this work, we introduce a new matched filter richness estimator, and test its performance using the maxBCG cluster catalog. Our new estimator significantly reduces the variance in the L_X-richness relation, from \sigma_{\ln L_X}^2=(0.86\pm0.02)^2 to \sigma_{\ln L_X}^2=(0.69\pm0.02)^2. Relative to the maxBCG richness estimate, it also removes the strong redshift dependence of the richness scaling relations, and is significantly more robust to photometric and redshift errors. These improvements are largely due to our more sophisticated treatment of galaxy color data. We also demonstrate the scatter in the L_X-richness relation depends on the aperture used to estimate cluster richness, and introduce a novel approach for optimizing said aperture which can be easily generalized to other mass tracers.},

Using mock galaxy catalogs tuned to reproduce the luminosity dependent correlation function and the empirical color-density relation measured in the SDSS, we characterize the maxBCG algorithm applied by Koester et al. to the SDSS galaxy catalog. We define and calibrate measures of completeness and purity for this algorithm, and demonstrate successful recovery of the underlying cosmology and HOD when applied to the mock catalogs. We identify principal components -- combinations of cosmology and HOD parameters -- that are recovered by survey counts as a function of richness, and demonstrate that percent-level accuracies are possible in the first two components, if the selection function can be understood to ~15% accuracy.},

Assuming a flat \LambdaCDM cosmology, we find \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.25)^{0.41} = 0.832\pm 0.033 after marginalization over all systematics. In common with previous studies, our error budget is dominated by systematic uncertainties, the primary two being the absolute mass scale of the weak lensing masses of the maxBCG clusters, and uncertainty in the scatter of the richness--mass relation. Our constraints are fully consistent with the WMAP five-year data, and in a joint analysis we find \sigma_8=0.807\pm 0.020 and \Omega_m=0.265\pm 0.016, an improvement of nearly a factor of two relative to WMAP5 alone. Our results are also in excellent agreement with and comparable in precision to the latest cosmological constraints from X-ray cluster abundances. The remarkable consistency among these results demonstrates that cluster abundance constraints are not only tight but also robust, and highlight the power of optically-selected cluster samples to produce precision constraints on cosmological parameters.},

To achieve the required sensitivity and resolution, the telescope design employs an off-axis primary with a 10 meter diameter clear aperture. The full aperture and the associated optics will have a combined surface accuracy of better than 20 microns rms to allow precision operation in the submillimeter atmospheric windows. The telescope will be surrounded with a large reflecting ground screen to reduce sensitivity to thermal emission from the ground and local interference. The optics of the telescope will support a degree field of view at 2mm wavelength and will feed a new 1000-element micro-lithographed planar bolometric array with superconducting transition-edge sensors and frequency-multiplexed readouts. The first key project will be to conduct a survey over $\sim 4000$ degrees for galaxy clusters using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect. This survey should find many thousands of clusters with a mass selection criteria that is remarkably uniform with redshift. Armed with redshifts obtained from optical and infrared follow-up observations, it is expected that the survey will enable significant constraints to be placed on the equation of state of the dark energy.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe redMaPPer, a new red sequence cluster finder specifically designed to make optimal use of ongoing and near-future large photometric surveys. The algorithm has multiple attractive features: (1) it can iteratively self-train the red sequence model based on a minimal spectroscopic training sample, an important feature for high-redshift surveys. (2) It can handle complex masks with varying depth. (3) It produces cluster-appropriate random points to enable large-scale structure studies. (4) All clusters are assigned a full redshift probability distribution P(z). (5) Similarly, clusters can have multiple candidate central galaxies, each with corresponding centering probabilities. (6) The algorithm is parallel and numerically efficient: it can run a Dark Energy Survey-like catalog in ~500 CPU hours. (7) The algorithm exhibits excellent photometric redshift performance, the richness estimates are tightly correlated with external mass proxies, and the completeness and purity of the corresponding catalogs are superb. We apply the redMaPPer algorithm to ~10, 000 deg2 of SDSS DR8 data and present the resulting catalog of ~25,000 clusters over the redshift range z in [0.08, 0.55]. The redMaPPer photometric redshifts are nearly Gaussian, with a scatter σ z ≈ 0.006 at z ≈ 0.1, increasing to σ z ≈ 0.02 at z ≈ 0.5 due to increased photometric noise near the survey limit. The median value for |Δz|/(1 + z) for the full sample is 0.006. The incidence of projection effects is low (<=5%). Detailed performance comparisons of the redMaPPer DR8 cluster catalog to X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich catalogs are presented in a companion paper.},

  Abstract                 = {We forecast the constraints on the values of σ8,Ωm and cluster scaling-relation parameters which we expect to obtain from the XMM Cluster Survey (XCS). We assume a flat Λ cold dark matter Universe and perform a Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis of the evolution of the number density of galaxy clusters that takes into account a detailed simulated selection function. Comparing our current observed number of clusters shows good agreement with predictions. We determine the expected degradation of the constraints as a result of self-calibrating the luminosity-temperature relation (with scatter), including temperature measurement errors, and relying on photometric methods for the estimation of galaxy cluster redshifts. We examine the effects of systematic errors in scaling relation and measurement error assumptions. Using only (T, z) self-calibration, we expect to measure Ωm to +/-0.03 (and ΩΛ to the same accuracy assuming flatness), and σ8 to +/-0.05, also constraining the normalization and slope of the luminosity-temperature relation to +/-6 and +/-13 per cent (at 1σ), respectively, in the process. Self-calibration fails to jointly constrain the scatter and redshift evolution of the luminosity-temperature relation significantly. Additional archival and/or follow-up data will improve on this. We do not expect measurement errors or imperfect knowledge of their distribution to degrade constraints significantly. Scaling-relation systematics can easily lead to cosmological constraints 2σ or more away from the fiducial model. Our treatment is the first exact treatment to this level of detail, and introduces a new `smoothed ML' (Maximum Likelihood) estimate of expected constraints.},

We discuss the current observational situation focusing on cosmological tests of Lambda including the age of the universe, high redshift supernovae, gravitational lensing, galaxy clustering and the cosmic microwave background. We also review the theoretical debate surrounding Lambda: the generation of Lambda in models with spontaneous symmetry breaking and through quantum vacuum polarization effects -- mechanisms which are known to give rise to alarge value of Lambda hence leading to the `cosmological constant problem'. More recent attempts to generate a small cosmological constant at the present epoch using either field theoretic techniques, or by modeling a dynamical Lambda-term by scalar fields are also extensively discussed. Anthropic arguments favouring a small cosmological constant are briefly reviewed. A comprehensive bibliography of recent work on Lambda is provided.},

In this paper we examine the invariant characterization for the energy-momentum tensor of phantom fields through the Segre algebraic classification in the framework of general relativity. We also discuss some constraints which are imposed on the values of $V(\phi)$ from the classical energy conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to shed some light on the current discussion about f(R)-gravity theories we derive and discuss the bounds imposed by the energy conditions on a general f(R) functional form. The null and strong energy conditions in this framework are derived from the Raychaudhuri's equation along with the requirement that gravity is attractive, whereas the weak and dominant energy conditions are stated from a comparison with the energy conditions that can be obtained in a direct approach via an effective energy-momentum tensor for f(R)-gravity. As a concrete application of the energy conditions to locally homogeneous and isotropic f(R)-cosmology, the recent estimated values of the deceleration and jerk parameters are used to examine the bounds from the weak energy condition on the parameters of two families of f(R)-gravity theories.},

  Abstract                 = {In general relativity, the energy conditions are invoked to restrict general energy-momentum tensors on physical grounds. We show that in the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) approach to cosmological modeling, where the energy and matter components of the cosmic fluid are unknown, the energy conditions provide model-independent bounds on the behavior of the lookback time of cosmic sources as a function of the redshift for any value of the spatial curvature. We also confront such bounds with a lookback time sample which is built from the age estimates of 32 galaxies lying in the interval $0.11 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.84$ and by assuming the total expanding age of the Universe to be $13.7 \pm 0.2$ Gyr, as obtained from current cosmic microwave background experiments. In agreement with previous results, we show that all energy conditions seem to have been violated at some point of the recent past of cosmic evolution.},

Formal expressions for the power spectrum, the N-point correlation functions, and the density distribution function are derived. These results are applied to the case of uncorrelated seed masses, and power spectra are derived for accretion of both hot and cold dark matter plus baryons. The reduced moments (cumulants) of the density distribution are computed and used to obtain a series expansion for the density distribution function. Analytic results are obtained for the density distribution function in the case of a distribution of seed masses with a spherical top-hat accretion pattern. More generally, the formalism makes it possible to give a complete characterization of the statistical properties of any random field generated from a discrete linear superposition of kernels. In particular, the results can be applied to density fields derived by smoothing a discrete set of points with a window function.},

The combination of REFLEX X-ray cluster and type-Ia supernova data shows that for a flat Universe the strong energy condition might presently be violated whereas the null energy condition seems to be fulfilled. This provides another observational argument for the present accelerated cosmic expansion and the absence of exotic physical phenomena related to a broken null energy condition. The marginalization of the likelihood distributions is performed in a manner to include a large fraction of the recently discussed possible systematic errors involved in the application of X-ray clusters as cosmological probes. This yields for a flat Universe, $\Omega_m=0.29^{+0.08}_{-0.12}$ and $w_x=-0.95^{+0.30}_{-0.35}$ ($1\sigma$ errors without cosmic variance). The scatter in the different analyses indicates a quite robust result around $w_x=-1$, leaving little room for the introduction of new energy components described by quintessence-like models or phantom energy. The most natural interpretation of the data is a positive cosmological constant with $w_x=-1 or something like it.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a refined treatment of H, He I, and He II recombination in the early universe. The difference from previous calculations is that we use multilevel atoms and evolve the population of each level with redshift by including all bound-bound and bound-free transitions. In this framework we follow several hundred atomic energy levels for H, He I, and He II combined. The main improvements of this method over previous recombination calculations are (1) allowing excited atomic level populations to depart from an equilibrium distribution, (2) replacing the total recombination coefficient with recombination to and photoionization from each level calculated directly at each redshift step, and (3) correct treatment of the He I atom, including the triplet and singlet states. We find that xe(=ne/nH) is approximately 10% smaller at redshifts <~800 than in previous calculations, as a result of the nonequilibrium of the excited states of H that is caused by the strong but cool radiation field at those redshifts. In addition, we find that He I recombination is delayed compared with previous calculations and occurs only just before H recombination. These changes in turn can affect the predicted power spectrum of microwave anisotropies at the few percent level. Other improvements, such as including molecular and ionic species of H, including complete heating and cooling terms for the evolution of the matter temperature, including collisional rates, and including feedback of the secondary spectral distortions on the radiation field, produce negligible change to the ionization fraction. The lower xe at low z found in this work affects the abundances of H molecular and ionic species by 10%-25%. However, this difference is probably not larger than other uncertainties in the reaction rates.},

  Abstract                 = {We present constraints on cosmological parameters based on a sample of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich-selected (SZ-selected) galaxy clusters detected in a millimeter-wave survey by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The cluster sample used in this analysis consists of nine optically confirmed high-mass clusters comprising the high-significance end of the total cluster sample identified in 455 deg2 of sky surveyed during 2008 at 148 GHz. We focus on the most massive systems to reduce the degeneracy between unknown cluster astrophysics and cosmology derived from SZ surveys. We describe the scaling relation between cluster mass and SZ signal with a four-parameter fit. Marginalizing over the values of the parameters in this fit with conservative priors gives 8 = 0.851 0.115 and w = -1.14 0.35 for a spatially flat wCDM cosmological model with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) seven-year priors on cosmological parameters. This gives a modest improvement in statistical uncertainty over WMAP seven-year constraints alone. Fixing the scaling relation between the cluster mass and SZ signal to a fiducial relation obtained from numerical simulations and calibrated by X-ray observations, we find 8 = 0.821 0.044 and w = -1.05 0.20. These results are consistent with constraints from WMAP7 plus baryon acoustic oscillations plus Type Ia supernova which give 8 = 0.802 0.038 and w = -0.98 0.053. A stacking analysis of the clusters in this sample compared to clusters simulated assuming the fiducial model also shows good agreement. These results suggest that, given the sample of clusters used here, both the astrophysics of massive clusters and the cosmological parameters derived from them are broadly consistent with current models.},

  Abstract                 = {An important issue in cosmology is reconstructing the effective dark energy equation of state directly from observations. With few physically motivated models, future dark energy studies cannot only be based on constraining a dark energy parameter space, as the errors found depend strongly on the parametrisation considered. We present a new non-parametric approach to reconstructing the history of the expansion rate and dark energy using Gaussian Processes, which is a fully Bayesian approach for smoothing data. We present a pedagogical introduction to Gaussian Processes, and discuss how it can be used to robustly differentiate data in a suitable way. Using this method we show that the Dark Energy Survey - Supernova Survey (DES) can accurately recover a slowly evolving equation of state to w = 0.05 (95% CL) at z = 0 and 0.25 at z = 0.7, with a minimum error of 0.025 at the sweet-spot at z ~ 0.16, provided the other parameters of the model are known. Errors on the expansion history are an order of magnitude smaller, yet make no assumptions about dark energy whatsoever. A code for calculating functions and their first three derivatives using Gaussian processes has been developed and is available for download.},

We show that the presented method performs very well in reconstruction of the expansion history of the universe independent of the underlying models and it works well even for non-trivial dark energy models with fast or slow changes in the equation of state of dark energy. Accuracy of the reconstructed quantities along with independence of the method to any prior or assumption gives the proposed method advantages to the other non-parametric methods proposed before in the literature. Applying on the Union 2.1 supernovae combined with WiggleZ BAO data we present the reconstructed results and test the consistency of the two data sets in a model independent manner. Results show that latest available supernovae and BAO data are in good agreement with each other and spatially flat ΛCDM model is in concordance with the current data.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a lensing study of 42 galaxy clusters imaged in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) commissioning data. Cluster candidates are selected optically from SDSS imaging data and confirmed for this study by matching to X-ray sources found independently in the ROSAT all sky survey (RASS). Five color SDSS photometry is used to make accurate photometric redshift estimates that are used to rescale and combine the lensing measurements. The mean shear from these clusters is detected to 2 h-1 Mpc at the 7-sigma level, corresponding to a mass within that radius of 4.2 +/- 0.6 x 10^14 h-1 M_sun. The shear profile is well fit by a power law with index -0.9 +/- 0.3, consistent with that of an isothermal density profile. This paper demonstrates our ability to measure ensemble cluster masses from SDSS imaging data.},

  Abstract                 = {This is the first in a series of papers on the weak lensing effect caused by clusters of galaxies in Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The photometrically selected cluster sample, known as MaxBCG, includes ~130,000 objects between redshift 0.1 and 0.3, ranging in size from small groups to massive clusters. We split the clusters into bins of richness and luminosity and stack the surface density contrast to produce mean radial profiles. The mean profiles are detected over a range of scales, from the inner halo (25 kpc/h) well into the surrounding large scale structure (30 Mpc/h), with a significance of 15 to 20 in each bin. The signal over this large range of scales is best interpreted in terms of the cluster-mass cross-correlation function. We pay careful attention to sources of systematic error, correcting for them where possible. The resulting signals are calibrated to the ~10\% level, with the dominant remaining uncertainty being the redshift distribution of the background sources. We find that the profiles scale strongly with richness and luminosity. We find the signal within a given richness bin depends upon luminosity, suggesting that luminosity is more closely correlated with mass than galaxy counts. We split the samples by redshift but detect no significant evolution. The profiles are not well described by power laws. In a subsequent series of papers we invert the profiles to three-dimensional mass profiles, show that they are well fit by a halo model description, measure mass-to-light ratios and provide a cosmological interpretation.},

  Abstract                 = {It is known that modeling uncertainties and astrophysical foregrounds can potentially introduce appreciable bias in the deduced values of cosmological parameters. While it is commonly assumed that these uncertainties will be accounted for to a sufficient level of precision, the level of bias has not been properly quantified in most cases of interest. We show that the requirement that the bias in derived values of cosmological parameters does not surpass nominal statistical error, translates into a maximal level of overall error O(N-½) on |ΔP(k)|/P(k) and |ΔCl|/Cl, where P(k), Cl, and N are the matter power spectrum, angular power spectrum, and number of (independent Fourier) modes at a given scale l or k probed by the cosmological survey, respectively. This required level has important consequences on the precision with which cosmological parameters are hoped to be determined by future surveys: in virtually all ongoing and near future surveys N typically falls in the range 106-109, implying that the required overall theoretical modeling and numerical precision is already very high. Future redshifted-21-cm observations, projected to sample ~ 1014 modes, will require knowledge of the matter power spectrum to a fantastic 10-7 precision level. We conclude that realizing the expected potential of future cosmological surveys, which aim at detecting 106-1014 modes, sets the formidable challenge of reducing the overall level of uncertainty to 10-3-10-7.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a formalism to characterize the redshift evolution of the dark energy potential. Our formalism makes use of quantities similar to the Horizon-flow parameters in inflation and is general enough that can deal with multiscalar quintessence scenarios, exotic matter components, and higher order curvature corrections to General Relativity. We show how the shape of the dark energy potential can be recovered non parametrically using this formalism and we present approximations analogous to the ones relevant to slow-roll inflation. Since presently available data do not allow a non-parametric and exact reconstruction of the potential, we consider a general parametric description. This reconstruction can also be used in other approaches followed in the literature (e.g., the reconstruction of the redshift evolution of the dark energy equation of state w(z)). Using observations of passively evolving galaxies and supernova data we derive constraints on the dark energy potential shape in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.8. Our findings show that at the 1sigma level the potential is consistent with being constant, although at the same level of confidence variations cannot be excluded with current data. We forecast constraints achievable with future data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope.},

This note gives estimates of where the regime of applicability of Limber's equation stops. Methods: This paper revisits Limber's equation and compares its predictions to the accurate integral of which the Limber equation is an approximation for some realistic situations. Thereby, the accuracy of the approximation is quantified. Different cases of spatial correlation functions are considered. Results: Limber's equation is accurate for small galaxy separations but breaks down beyond a certain separation that depends mainly on the ratio σ/rm and to some degree on the power-law index of spatial clustering; σ is the 1-width of the galaxy distribution in comoving distance, and rm the mean comoving distance. Limber's equation introduces a 10% systematic error that may be important at a scale of about a few degrees or in some cases, narrow galaxy distributions for example, even at arcmin scales. An alternative integral for such cases is given inside this paper.},

The Fisher information matrix is constructed with the full covariance matrix, including the correlation between nearby redshift shells arising from the photometric redshift error. We show that under some reasonable assumptions, a survey such as the imminent Dark Energy Survey should be able to constrain the dark energy equation of state parameter w and the cold dark matter density Lambdacdm with a precision of the order of 20% and 13%, respectively, from the full shape of the angular correlation function alone.

  Abstract                 = {A simple cosmological model with only six parameters (matter density, Omega_m h^2, baryon density, Omega_b h^2, Hubble Constant, H_0, amplitude of fluctuations, sigma_8, optical depth, tau, and a slope for the scalar perturbation spectrum, n_s) fits not only the three year WMAP temperature and polarization data, but also small scale CMB data, light element abundances, large-scale structure observations, and the supernova luminosity/distance relationship. Using WMAP data only, the best fit values for cosmological parameters for the power-law flat LCDM model are (Omega_m h^2, Omega_b h^2, h, n_s, tau, sigma_8) = 0.1277+0.0080-0.0079, 0.02229+-0.00073, 0.732+0.031-0.032, 0.958+-0.016, 0.089+-0.030, 0.761+0.049-0.048). The three year data dramatically shrink the allowed volume in this six dimensional parameter space. Assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power law spectrum, the WMAP data_alone_ require dark matter, and favor a spectral index that is significantly less than the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant spectrum (n_s=1, r=0). Models that suppress large-scale power through a running spectral index or a large-scale cut-off in the power spectrum are a better fit to the WMAP and small scale CMB data than the power-law LCDM model; however, the improvement in the fit to the WMAP data is only Delta chi^2 = 3 for 1 extra degree of freedom. The combination of WMAP and other astronomical data yields significant constraints on the geometry of the universe, the equation of state of the dark energy, the gravitational wave energy density, and neutrino properties. Consistent with the predictions of simple inflationary theories, we detect no significant deviations from Gaussianity in the CMB maps.},

  Abstract                 = {WMAP precision data enables accurate testing of cosmological models. We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat Lambda-dominated universe seeded by nearly scale-invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale CMB measurements and measurements of large scle structure (galaxy surveys and the Lyman alpha forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), 2dFGRS measurements and Lyman alpha forest data to find the model's best fit cosmological parameters: h=0.71+0.04-0.03, Omega_b h^2=0.0224+-0.0009, Omega_m h^2=0.135+0.008-0.009, tau=0.17+-0.06, n_s(0.05/Mpc)=0.93+-0.03, and sigma_8=0.84+-0.04. WMAP's best determination of tau=0.17+-0.04 arises directly from the TE data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. These parameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7+-0.2 Gyr. The data favors but does not require a slowly varying spectral index. By combining WMAP data with other astronomical data sets, we constrain the geometry of the universe, Omega_tot = 1.02 +- 0.02, the equation of state of the dark energy w < -0.78 (95\% confidence limit assuming w >= -1), and the energy density in stable neutrinos, Omega_nu h^2 < 0.0076 (95\% confidence limit). For 3 degenerate neutrino species, this limit implies that their mass is less than 0.23 eV (95\% confidence limit). The WMAP detection of early reionization rules out warm dark matter.},

  Abstract                 = {The South Pole Telescope (SPT) is conducting a Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect survey over large areas of the southern sky, searching for massive galaxy clusters to high redshift. In this preliminary study, we focus on a 40 deg2 area targeted by the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS), which is centered roughly at right ascension 5h30m, declination -53 (J2000). Over two seasons of observations, this entire region has been mapped by the SPT at 95 GHz, 150 GHz, and 225 GHz. We report the four most significant SPT detections of SZ clusters in this field, three of which were previously unknown and, therefore, represent the first galaxy clusters discovered with an SZ survey. The SZ clusters are detected as decrements with greater than 5 significance in the high-sensitivity 150 GHz SPT map. The SZ spectrum of these sources is confirmed by detections of decrements at the corresponding locations in the 95 GHz SPT map and nondetections at those locations in the 225 GHz SPT map. Multiband optical images from the BCS survey demonstrate significant concentrations of similarly colored galaxies at the positions of the SZ detections. Photometric redshift estimates from the BCS data indicate that two of the clusters lie at moderate redshift (z ~ 0.4) and two at high redshift (z gsim 0.8). One of the SZ detections was previously identified as a galaxy cluster in the optical as part of the Abell supplementary southern cluster catalog and in the X-ray using data from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS). Potential RASS counterparts (not previously identified as clusters) are also found for two of the new discoveries. These first four galaxy clusters are the most significant SZ detections from a subset of the ongoing SPT survey. As such, they serve as a demonstration that SZ surveys, and the SPT in particular, can be an effective means for finding galaxy clusters.},

Following an overview of the key physics that controls the synthesis of the elements in the early Universe, the predictions of BBN in the standard (and some nonstandard) models of cosmology and particle physics are presented. The observational data used to infer the primordial abundances are described, with an emphasis on the distinction between precision and accuracy. These are compared with the predictions, testing the internal consistency of BBN and enabling a comparison of the BBN-inferred constraints with those derived from the cosmic microwave background radiation and large scale structure data.},

We complement these Keck spectra with high-quality, publicly available archival spectra from the SPICES and VVDS surveys. We improve over our previous expansion history measurements in Simon et al. (2005) by providing two new determinations of the expansion history: H(z) = 97±62 km sec-1 Mpc-1 at z simeq 0.5 and H(z) = 90±40 km sec-1 Mpc-1 at z simeq 0.9. We discuss the uncertainty in the expansion history determination that arises from uncertainties in the synthetic stellar-population models. We then use these new measurements in concert with cosmic-microwave-background (CMB) measurements to constrain cosmological parameters, with a special emphasis on dark-energy parameters and constraints to the curvature. In particular, we demonstrate the usefulness of direct H(z) measurements by constraining the dark-energy equation of state parameterized by w0 and wa and allowing for arbitrary curvature. Further, we also constrain, using only CMB and H(z) data, the number of relativistic degrees of freedom to be 4±0.5 and their total mass to be < 0.2 eV, both at 1σ.},

Following Geroch's (1969) treatment of limits of space-times, the present approach is based on the consideration of sequences or one-parameter families of space-times. The null tetrad formalism of Newman & Penrose (1962) is used to investigate what class of space-times a gauge-invariant analysis may be possible. It is found that the only space-times for which sufficiently many gauge-invariant quantities exist such that a general first order perturbation is completely determined by them are the vacuum space-times whose gravitational field (Weyl tensor) is algebraically special. The maximal subclass of space-times of special type for which the decoupled perturbation equations can be solved by separation of variables is found.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature power spectrum using data from the recently completed South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey. This measurement is made from observations of 2540 deg2 of sky with arcminute resolution at 150 GHz, and improves upon previous measurements using the SPT by tripling the sky area. We report CMB temperature anisotropy power over the multipole range 650 < l < 3000. We fit the SPT bandpowers, combined with the 7 yr Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP7) data, with a six-parameter ΛCDM cosmological model and find that the two datasets are consistent and well fit by the model. Adding SPT measurements significantly improves ΛCDM parameter constraints; in particular, the constraint on θ s tightens by a factor of 2.7. The impact of gravitational lensing is detected at 8.1σ, the most significant detection to date. This sensitivity of the SPT+WMAP7 data to lensing by large-scale structure at low redshifts allows us to constrain the mean curvature of the observable universe with CMB data alone to be {\Omega _{k}}=-0.003^{+0.014}_{-0.018}. Using the SPT+WMAP7 data, we measure the spectral index of scalar fluctuations to be ns = 0.9623 ± 0.0097 in the ΛCDM model, a 3.9σ preference for a scale-dependent spectrum with ns < 1. The SPT measurement of the CMB damping tail helps break the degeneracy that exists between the tensor-to-scalar ratio r and ns in large-scale CMB measurements, leading to an upper limit of r < 0.18 (95% C.L.) in the ΛCDM+r model. Adding low-redshift measurements of the Hubble constant (H 0) and the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature to the SPT+WMAP7 data leads to further improvements. The combination of SPT+WMAP7+H 0+BAO constrains ns = 0.9538 ± 0.0081 in the ΛCDM model, a 5.7σ detection of ns < 1, and places an upper limit of r < 0.11 (95% C.L.) in the ΛCDM+r model. These new constraints on ns and r have significant implications for our understanding of inflation, which we discuss in the context of selected single-field inflation models.},

Tables of the power spectrum of CMB anisotropies in the form of $C_\ell$'s as a function of $\ell$ are presented. Although the Harrison-Zeldovich initial spectrum is assumed in these tables, we present simple approximations for obtaining the $C_\ell$'s corresponding to a tilted spectrum from those with a Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum. The $\sigma_8$ values are obtained for the matter density spectrum, with $\sigma(10^\circ)$, fixed $Q_{rms-PS}$ and COBE DMR 2 year normalizations. Simple modifications of the fitting formula of the density transfer function which are applicable for models with high baryon density are given. By using both numerical results and these fitting formulae, we calculate the relation between $\sigma_8$ and $Q_{rms-PS}$, and find good agreement. Velocity fields are also calculated.},

  Abstract                 = {We demonstrate a model-independent method of estimating qualitative dynamics of an accelerating universe from observations of distant type Ia supernovae. Our method is based on the luminosity-distance function, optimized to fit observed distances of supernovae, and the Hamiltonian representation of dynamics for the quintessential universe with a general form of equation of state $p=w(a(z))\rho$. Because of the Hamiltonian structure of FRW dynamics with the equation of state $p = w(a(z)) \rho$, the dynamics is uniquelly determined by the potential function $V(a)$ of the system. The effectiveness of this method in discrimination of model parameters of Cardassian evolution scenario is also given. Our main result is the following, restricting to the flat model with the current value of $\Omega_{m,0}=0.3$, the constraints at $2\sigma$ confidence level to the presence of $\rho^{n}$ modification of the FRW models are $-0.50 \lesssim n \lesssim 0.36$.},

  Abstract                 = {Several dark energy experiments are available from a single large-area imaging survey and may be combined to improve cosmological parameter constraints and/or test inherent systematics. Two promising experiments are cosmic shear power spectra and counts of galaxy clusters. However, the two experiments probe the same cosmic mass density field in large-scale structure, therefore the combination may be less powerful than first thought. We investigate the cross-covariance between the cosmic shear power spectra and the cluster counts based on the halo model approach, where the cross-covariance arises from the three-point correlations of the underlying mass density field. Fully taking into account the cross-covariance, as well as non-Gaussian errors on the lensing power spectrum covariance, we find a significant cross-correlation between the lensing power spectrum signals at multipoles l~103 and the cluster counts containing halos with masses Mgsim1014 Modot. Including the cross-covariance for the combined measurement degrades and in some cases improves the total signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios up to ~±20% relative to when the two are independent. For cosmological parameter determination, the cross-covariance has a smaller effect as a result of working in a multi-dimensional parameter space, implying that the two observables can be considered independent to a good approximation. We also discuss the fact that cluster count experiments using lensing-selected mass peaks could be more complementary to cosmic shear tomography than mass-selected cluster counts of the corresponding mass threshold. Using lensing selected clusters with a realistic usable detection threshold ((S/N)cluster~6 for a ground-based survey), the uncertainty on each dark energy parameter may be roughly halved by the combined experiments, relative to using the power spectra alone.},

  Abstract                 = {For 40 years, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has been the most important source of information about the geometry and contents of the Universe. Even so, only a small fraction of the information available in the CMB has been extracted to date. Planck, the third space CMB mission after COBE and WMAP, is designed to extract essentially all of the information in the CMB temperature anisotropies. Planck will also measure to high accuracy the polarization of CMB anisotropies, which encodes not only a wealth of cosmological information but also provides a unique probe of the thermal history of the Universe during the time when the first stars and galaxies formed. Polarization measurements may also detect the signature of a stochastic background of gravitational waves generated during inflation, 10^(-35) s after the Big Bang. This book describes the expected scientific output of the Planck mission, both cosmological and non-cosmological. Chapter 1 summarizes the experimental concept and the operation of the satellite. Chapter 2 covers the core cosmological science of the mission, describing the measurements that Planck will make, what we expect to learn from them about the geometry and contents of the Universe and about fundamental physics, and the combination of CMB data with other data to provide additional insights. Although the primary goal of Planck is cosmology, it will survey the whole sky with an unprecedented combination of frequency coverage, angular resolution, and sensitivity, providing data valuable for a broad range of astrophysics. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 describe non-cosmological astrophysical uses of the Planck data. This book can also be downloaded directly from http://www.rssd.esa.int/Planck .},

  Abstract                 = {Percent-level measurements of the comoving baryon acoustic scale standard ruler can be used to break degeneracies in parameter constraints from the CMB alone. The sound horizon at the epoch of baryon drag is often used as a proxy for the scale of the peak in the matter density correlation function, and can conveniently be calculated quickly for different cosmological models. However, the measurements are not directly constraining this scale, but rather a measurement of the full correlation function, which depends on the detailed evolution through decoupling. We assess the level of reliability of parameter constraints based on a simple approximation of the acoustic scale compared to a more direct determination from the full numerical two-point correlation function. Using a five-parameter fitting technique similar to recent BAO data analyses, we find that for standard {\Lambda}CDM models and extensions with massive neutrinos and additional relativistic degrees of freedom, the approximation is at better than 0.15% for most parameter combinations varying over reasonable ranges.},

  Abstract                 = {The High-z Supernova Search Team has discovered and observed 8 new supernovae in the redshift interval z=0.3-1.2. These independent observations, confirm the result of Riess et al. (1998a) and Perlmutter et al. (1999) that supernova luminosity distances imply an accelerating universe. More importantly, they extend the redshift range of consistently observed SN Ia to z~1, where the signature of cosmological effects has the opposite sign of some plausible systematic effects. Consequently, these measurements not only provide another quantitative confirmation of the importance of dark energy, but also constitute a powerful qualitative test for the cosmological origin of cosmic acceleration. We find a rate for SN Ia of 1.4+/-0.5E-04 h^3/Mpc^3/yr at a mean redshift of 0.5. We present distances and host extinctions for 230 SN Ia. These place the following constraints on cosmological quantities: if the equation of state parameter of the dark energy is w=-1, then H0 t0 = 0.96+/-0.04, and O_l - 1.4 O_m = 0.35+/-0.14. Including the constraint of a flat Universe, we find O_m = 0.28+/-0.05, independent of any large-scale structure measurements. Adopting a prior based on the 2dF redshift survey constraint on O_m and assuming a flat universe, we find that the equation of state parameter of the dark energy lies in the range -1.48<w<-0.72 at 95\% confidence. If we further assume that w>-1, we obtain w<-0.73 at 95\% confidence. These constraints are similar in precision and in value to recent results reported using the WMAP satellite, also in combination with the 2dF redshift survey.},

  Abstract                 = {The redshift dependence of the abundance of galaxy clusters is very sensitive to the statistical properties of primordial density perturbations. It can thus be used to probe small deviations from Gaussian initial conditions. Such deviations constitute a very important signature of many inflationary scenarios, and are thus expected to provide crucial information on physical processes which took place in the very early Universe. We have determined the biases which may be introduced in the estimation of cosmological parameters by wrongly assuming the absence of primordial non-Gaussianities. Although we find that the estimation of the present-day dark energy density using cluster counts is not very sensitive to the non-Gaussian properties of the density field, we show that the biases can be considerably larger in the estimation of the dark energy equation of state parameter w and of the amplitude of the primordial density perturbations. Our results suggest that a significant level of non-Gaussianity at cluster scales may be able to reconcile the constraint on the amplitude of the primordial perturbations obtained using galaxy cluster number counts from the Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich Catalog with that obtained from the primary cosmic microwave background anisotropies measured by the Planck satellite.},

  Abstract                 = {General relativity marked the beginning of modern cosmology and it has since been at the centre of many of the key developments in this field. In the present review, we discuss the general-relativistic dynamics and perturbations of the standard cosmological model, the Friedmann Lemaitre universe, and how these can explain and predict the properties of the observable universe. Our aim is to provide an overview of the progress made in several major research areas, such as linear and non-linear cosmological perturbations, large-scale structure formation and the physics of the cosmic microwave background radiation, in view of current and upcoming observations. We do this by using a single formalism throughout the review, the 1+3 covariant approach to cosmology, which allows for a uniform and balanced presentation of technical information and physical insight.},

Taken at face-value, they provide direct lines of evidence that the Universe was decelerating in the past, an expected but untested feature of the current cosmological model. We show that the strength of this conclusion depends upon the nature of the dark energy causing the present acceleration. Only for a cosmological constant is the SNe evidence definitive. Using a new test which is independent of the contents of the Universe, we show that the SN data favor recent acceleration (z < 0.5) and past deceleration (z > 0.5).},

We show that this new unitary change of basis from the position x on the half line to the hyperbolic momentum p\eta, transforms the wavefunction via a Mellin transform on to the critical line s = 1/2-ip\eta. We utilize this new transform to find quantum wavefunctions whose hyperbolic momentum representation approximate a class of higher transcendental functions, and in particular, approximate the Riemann Zeta function. We finally give possible physical realizations to perform an indirect measurement of the hyperbolic momentum of a quantum system on the half-line.},

  Abstract                 = {Multi-connected universe models with space identification scales smaller than the size of the observable universe produce topological images of cosmic sources. We generalise to locally hyperbolic spaces the crystallographic method, aimed to detect the topology from three-dimensional catalogs of cosmological objects. Our new method is based on the construction of a {\it collecting-correlated-pair} technique which enhances the topological signature and can make it detectable. The main idea is that in multi-connected universes, equal distances occur more often than by chance. We present an idealised version of this method as well as numerical simulations, we discuss the statistical relevance of the expected signature and we show how the extraction of a topological signal may also lead to a precise determination of the cosmological parameters. A more realistic version of the method which takes account of uncertainties in the position and velocity data is then discussed. We apply our technique to presently available data, namely a quasar catalog, and discuss the significance of the result. We show how the improved crystallographic method both competes with the two--dimensional methods based on cosmic microwave background analyses, and suffers from the same drawback: the shortage of present observational data.},

We provide a full reference for the data analysis procedures, present updated calibration of relations between the total cluster mass and its X-ray indicators (TX , M gas, and YX ) based on a subsample of low-z relaxed clusters, and present a first measurement of the evolving LX -M tot relation (with M tot estimated from YX ) obtained from a well defined statistically complete cluster sample and with appropriate corrections for the Malmquist bias applied. Finally, we present the derived cluster mass functions, estimate the systematic uncertainties in this measurement, and discuss the calculation of the likelihood function. We confidently measure the evolution in the cluster comoving number density at a fixed mass threshold, e.g., by a factor of 5.0 +/- 1.2 at M 500 = 2.5 × 1014 h -1 M sun between z = 0 and 0.5. This evolution reflects the growth of density perturbations, and can be used for the cosmological constraints complementing those from the distance-redshift relation.},

  Abstract                 = {We present gas and total mass profiles for 13 low-redshift, relaxed clusters spanning a temperature range 0.7-9 keV, derived from all available Chandra data of sufficient quality. In all clusters, gas temperature profiles are measured to large radii (Vikhlinin et al.) so that direct hydrostatic mass estimates are possible to nearly r_500 or beyond. The gas density was accurately traced to larger radii; its profile is not described well by a beta-model, showing continuous steepening with radius. The derived rho_tot profiles and their scaling with mass generally follow the Navarro-Frenk-White model with concentration expected for dark matter halos in LambdaCDM cosmology. In the inner region (r<0.1r_500), the gas density and temperature profiles exhibit significant scatter and trends with mass, but they become nearly self-similar at larger radii. Correspondingly, we find that the slope of the mass-temperature relation for these relaxed clusters is in good agreement with the simple self-similar behavior, M_500 ~ T^alpha, where alpha=(1.5-1.6)+-0.1, if the gas temperatures are measured excluding the central cool cores. The normalization of this M-T relation is significantly, by =~ 30\%, higher than most previous X-ray determinations. We derive accurate gas mass fraction profiles, which show increase both with radius and cluster mass. The enclosed f_gas profiles within r_2500 =~ 0.4 r_500 have not yet reached any asymptotic value and are still far (by a factor of 1.5-2) from the Universal baryon fraction according to the CMB observations. The f_gas trends become weaker and its values closer to Universal at larger radii, in particular, in spherical shells r_2500<r<r_500.},

  Abstract                 = {Chandra observations of large samples of galaxy clusters detected in X-rays by ROSAT provide a new, robust determination of the cluster mass functions at low and high redshifts. Statistical and systematic errors are now sufficiently small, and the redshift leverage sufficiently large for the mass function evolution to be used as a useful growth of a structure-based dark energy probe. In this paper, we present cosmological parameter constraints obtained from Chandra observations of 37 clusters with langzrang = 0.55 derived from 400 deg2 ROSAT serendipitous survey and 49 brightest z 0.05 clusters detected in the All-Sky Survey. Evolution of the mass function between these redshifts requires > 0 with a ~5 significance, and constrains the dark energy equation-of-state parameter to w 0 = -1.14 0.21, assuming a constant w and a flat universe. Cluster information also significantly improves constraints when combined with other methods. Fitting our cluster data jointly with the latest supernovae, Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, and baryonic acoustic oscillation measurements, we obtain w 0 = -0.991 0.045 (stat) 0.039 (sys), a factor of 1.5 reduction in statistical uncertainties, and nearly a factor of 2 improvement in systematics compared with constraints that can be obtained without clusters. The joint analysis of these four data sets puts a conservative upper limit on the masses of light neutrinos m < 0.33 eV at 95% CL. We also present updated measurements of M h and 8 from the low-redshift cluster mass function.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new method for deriving cosmological constraints based on the evolution of the baryon mass function of galaxy clusters and implement it using 17 distant clusters from our 160 deg2 ROSAT survey. The method uses the cluster baryon mass as a proxy for the total mass, thereby avoiding the large uncertainties of the Mtot-T or Mtot-LX relations used in all previous studies. Instead, we rely on a well-founded assumption that the Mb/Mtot ratio is a universal quantity, which should result in a much smaller systematic uncertainty. Taking advantage of direct and accurate Chandra measurements of the gas masses for distant clusters, we find strong evolution of the baryon mass function between z>0.4 and the present. The observed evolution defines a narrow band in the m- plane, m+0.23=0.41+/-0.10 at 68% confidence, which intersects with constraints from the cosmic microwave background and Type Ia supernovae near m=0.3 and =0.7.},

  Abstract                 = {Taylor expanding the cosmological equation of state around the current epoch is the simplest model one can consider that does not make any a priori restrictions on the nature of the cosmological fluid. Most popular cosmological models attempt to be ``predictive'', in the sense that once somea priori equation of state is chosen the Friedmann equations are used to determine the evolution of the FRW scale factor a(t). In contrast, a retrodictive approach might usefully take observational dataconcerning the scale factor, and use the Friedmann equations to infer an observed cosmological equation of state. In particular, the value and derivatives of the scale factor determined at the current epoch place constraints on the value and derivatives of the cosmological equation of state at the current epoch. Determining the first three Taylor coefficients of the equation of state at the current epoch requires a measurement of the deceleration, jerk, and snap -- the second, third, and fourth derivatives of the scale factor with respect to time. Higher-order Taylor coefficients in the equation of state are related to higher-order time derivatives of the scale factor. Since the jerk and snap are rather difficult to measure, being related to the third and fourth terms in the Taylor series expansion of the Hubble law, it becomes clear why direct observational constraints on the cosmological equation of state are so relatively weak; and are likely to remain weak for the foreseeable future.},

  Abstract                 = {The immediate observational consequence of a non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe is that an observer could potentially detect multiple images of radiating sources. In particular, a non-trivial topology will generate pairs of correlated circles of temperature fluctuations in the anisotropies maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the so-called circles-in-the-sky. In this way, a detectable non-trivial spatial topology may be seen as an observable attribute, which can be probed through the circles-in-the-sky for all locally homogeneous and isotropic universes with no assumptions on the cosmological dark energy (DE) equation of state (EOS) parameters. We show that the knowledge of the spatial topology through the circles-in-the-sky offers an effective way of reducing the degeneracies in the DE EOS parameters. We concretely illustrate the topological role by assuming, as an exanple, a Poincar\'{e} dodecahedral space topology and reanalyzing the constraints on the parameters of a specific EOS which arise from the supernovae type Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations and the CMB plus the statistical topological contribution.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been shown that a contracting universe with a dust-like ($w \approx 0$) fluid may provide an almost scale invariant spectrum for the gravitational scalar perturbations. As the universe contracts, the amplitude of such perturbations are amplified. The gauge invariant variable $\Phi$ develops a growing mode which becomes much larger than the constant one around the bounce phase. The constant mode has its amplitude fixed by Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) normalization, thus the amplitude of the growing mode can become much larger than 1. In this paper, we first show that this is a general feature of bouncing models, since we expect that general relativity should be valid in all scales away from the bounce. However, in the Newtonian gauge, the variable $\Phi$ gives the value of the metric perturbation $\phi$, raising doubts on the validity of the linear perturbative regime at the bounce. In order to address this issue, we obtain a set of necessary conditions for the perturbative series to be valid along the whole history of the model, and we show that there is a gauge in which all these conditions are satisfied, for a set of models, if the constant mode is fixed by COBE normalization. As a by-product of this analysis, we point out that there are sets of solutions for the perturbation variables where some gauge-fixing conditions are not well defined, turning these gauges prohibited for those solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {It is believed that soon after the Planck era, spacetime should have a semi-classical nature. In this context we consider quantum fields propagating in a classical gravitational field and study the backreaction of these fields, using the expected value of the energy-momentum tensor as source of the gravitational field. According to this theory, the escape from General Relativity theory is unavoidable. Two geometric counter-term are needed to regularize the divergences which come from the expected value. There is a parameter associated to each counter-term and in this work we found numerical solutions of this theory to particular initial conditions, for general Bianchi Type I spaces. We show that even though there are spurious solutions some of them can be considered physical. These physical solutions include de Sitter and Minkowski that are obtained asymptotically.},

  Abstract                 = {The most successful cosmological models to date envision structure formation as a hierarchical process in which gravity is constantly drawing lumps of matter together to form increasingly larger structures. Clusters of galaxies currently sit atop this hierarchy as the largest objects that have had time to collapse under the influence of their own gravity. Thus, their appearance on the cosmic scene is also relatively recent. Two features of clusters make them uniquely useful tracers of cosmic evolution. First, clusters are the biggest things whose masses we can reliably measure because they are the largest objects to have undergone gravitational relaxation and entered into virial equilibrium. Mass measurements of nearby clusters can therefore be used to determine the amount of structure in the universe on scales of 10^14 to 10^15 solar masses, and comparisons of the present-day cluster mass distribution with the mass distribution at earlier times can be used to measure the rate of structure formation, placing important constraints on cosmological models. Second, clusters are essentially ``closed boxes'' that retain all their gaseous matter, despite the enormous energy input associated with supernovae and active galactic nuclei, because the gravitational potential wells of clusters are so deep. The baryonic component of clusters therefore contains a wealth of information about the processes associated with galaxy formation, including the efficiency with which baryons are converted into stars and the effects of the resulting feedback processes on galaxy formation. This article reviews our theoretical understanding of both the dark-matter component and the baryonic component of clusters. (Abridged)},

  Abstract                 = {Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), galaxy clustering, and cosmic microwave background anisotropy (CMB) data provide complementary constraints on the nature of the dark energy in the universe. We find that the three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) observations give a CMB shift parameter of R = (\Omega_m H_0^2)^{1/2} \int_0^{z_CMB} dz'/H(z')= 1.70 \pm 0.03. Using this new measured value of the CMB shift parameter, together with the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurement from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and SN Ia data from the HST/GOODS program and the first year Supernova Legacy Survey, we derive model-independent constraints on the dark energy density rho_X(z) and the cosmic expansion rate H(z). We also derive constraints on the dark energy equation of state w_X(z)=w_0+w'z (with cutoff at z=2) and w_X(a)=w_0+(1-a)w_a. We find that current data provide slightly tighter constraints on rho_X(z) and H(z) as free functions in redshift, and roughly a factor of two improvement in constraining w_X(z). A cosmological constant remains consistent with data, however, uncertainties remain large for model-independent constraints of dark energy. Significant increase in the number of observed SNe Ia between redshifts of 1 and 2, complemented by improved BAO and weak lensing cosmography measurements (as expected from the JEDI mission concept for the Joint Dark Energy Mission), will be required to dramatically tighten model-independent dark energy constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we investigate how the dark matter halo mass function evolves with redshift, based on a suite of very large (with Np = 30723-60003 particles) cosmological N-body simulations. Our halo catalogue data span a redshift range of z = 0-30, allowing us to probe the mass function from the Dark Ages to the present. We utilize both the friends-of-friends (FOF) and spherical overdensity (SO) halo-finding methods to directly compare the mass function derived using these commonly used halo definitions. The mass function from SO haloes exhibits a clear evolution with redshift, especially during the recent era of dark energy dominance (z < 1). We provide a redshift-parametrized fit for the SO mass function valid for the entire redshift range to within 20 per cent as well as a scheme to calculate the mass function for haloes with arbitrary overdensities. The FOF mass function displays a weaker evolution with redshift. We provide a `universal' fit for the FOF mass function, fitted to data across the entire redshift range simultaneously, and observe redshift evolution in our data versus this fit. The relative evolution of the mass functions derived via the two methods is compared. For an SO halo defined via an overdensity of 178 versus the background matter density and an FOF halo defined via a linking length of 0.2 times the mean interparticle separation we find that the mass functions most closely match at z = 0. The disparity at z = 0 between the FOF and SO mass functions resides in their high-mass tails where the collapsed fraction of mass in SO haloes is 80 per cent of that in FOF haloes.

  Abstract                 = {When the density parameter is close to unity, the universe has a large curvature radius independently of its being hyperbolic, flat, or spherical. Whatever the curvature, the universe may have either a simply connected or a multiply connected topology. In the flat case, the topology scale is arbitrary, and there is no a priori reason for this scale to be of the same order as the size of the observable universe. In the hyperbolic case any nontrivial topology would almost surely be on a length scale too large to detect. In the spherical case, by contrast, the topology could easily occur on a detectable scale. The present paper shows how, in the spherical case, the assumption of a nearly flat universe simplifies the algorithms for detecting a multiply connected topology, but also reduces the amount of topology that can be seen. This is of primary importance for the upcoming cosmic microwave background data analysis. This article shows that for spherical spaces one may restrict the search to diametrically opposite pairs of circles in the circles-in-the-sky method and still detect the cyclic factor in the standard factorization of the holonomy group. This vastly decreases the algorithm's run time. If the search is widened to include pairs of candidate circles whose centers are almost opposite and whose relative twist varies slightly, then the cyclic factor along with a cyclic subgroup of the general factor may also be detected. Unfortunately the full holonomy group is, in general, unobservable in a nearly flat spherical universe, and so a full 6-parameter search is unnecessary. Crystallographic methods could also potentially detect the cyclic factor and a cyclic subgroup of the general factor, but nothing else.},

The CMB angular power spectrum and the matter transfer function are presented, along with a discussion of their relative normalization. This represents the first full numerical evolution of density perturbations and anisotropies in a spherical geometry. We extend the likelihood function versus from the COBE 2 year data to > 1. For large the presence of a very steep rise in the spectrum toward low t' allows us to put an upper limit of < 1.5 (95% CL) for primordial spectra with n < 1. This compares favorably with existing limits on . We show that there are a range of closed models that are consistent with observational constraints while being even older than the currently popular flat models with a cosmological constant. Future constraints from degree scale CMB data may soon probe this region of parameter space. A derivation of the perturbed Einstein, fluid, and Boltzmann equations for open and closed geometries is presented in an Appendix.},

With this interpretation, the new solution presented here replaces the Friedmann solutions, in representing the average evolution of a matter-dominated universe without exotic dark energy, while being observationally viable.},

We analyse the performance of future Dark Energy Task Force (DETF) stage-III and stage-IV dark-energy surveys using supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations and weak lensing as probes. We concentrate in particular on the dark-energy equation of state parameters w0 and wa. For purely geometrical probes, and especially when marginalising over wa, we find considerable disagreement between the two methods, since in this case the Fisher matrix can not reproduce the highly non-elliptical shape of the likelihood function. More quantitatively, the Fisher method underestimates the marginalized errors for purely geometrical probes between 30%-70%. For cases including structure formation such as weak lensing, we find that the posterior probability contours from the Fisher matrix estimation are in good agreement with the MCMC contours and the forecasted errors only changing on the 5% level. We then explore non-linear transformations resulting in physically-motivated parameters and investigate whether these parameterisations exhibit a Gaussian behaviour. We conclude that for the purely geometrical probes and, more generally, in cases where it is not known whether the likelihood is close to Gaussian, the Fisher matrix is not the appropriate tool to produce reliable forecasts.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the impact of theoretical uncertainty in the dark matter halo mass function and halo bias on dark energy constraints from imminent galaxy cluster surveys. We find that for an optical cluster survey like the Dark Energy Survey, the accuracy required on the predicted halo mass function to make it an insignificant source of error on dark energy parameters is ~ 1\%. The analogous requirement on the predicted halo bias is less stringent (~ 5\%), particularly if the observable-mass distribution can be well constrained by other means. These requirements depend upon survey area but are relatively insensitive to survey depth. The most stringent requirements are likely to come from a survey over a significant fraction of the sky that aims to observe clusters down to relatively low mass, Mth ~ 10^13.7 Msun/h; for such a survey, the mass function and halo bias must be predicted to accuracies of ~ 0.5\% and ~ 1\%, respectively. These accuracies represent a limit on the practical need to calibrate ever more accurate halo mass and bias functions. We find that improving predictions for the mass function in the low-redshift and low-mass regimes is the most effective way to improve dark energy constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an efficient method of computing cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies in nonflat universes. First, we derive the Boltzmann equation for CMB temperature and polarization fluctuations produced by scalar perturbations in a general Robertson-Walker universe. We then apply the integral method in order to solve this equation, writing temperature and polarization anisotropies as a time integral over a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical terms can be written using ultra-spherical Bessel functions, which depend on curvature. These cannot be precomputed, as for flat space. Instead, we solve their differential equation directly for selected values of the multipoles. The resulting computational time is comparable to the flat-space case, improving over previous methods by 2-3 orders of magnitude. This allows one to compute highly accurate CMB temperature and polarization spectra, matter transfer functions, and their CMB normalizations for any cosmological model, thereby avoiding the need to use the various inexact fitting formulae that exist in the literature.},

Here, we consider two kinds of H(z) data: the direct H0 probe from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of Cepheid variables with H0 = 73.8 ± 2.4 km s-1 Mpc-1 and several measurements on the Hubble parameter at high redshifts H(z). Employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we also combine the WMAP nine-year data (WMAP9), the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and type Ia supernovae (SNIa) Union2.1 compilation to determine the cosmological parameters, such as the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy w, the curvature of the universe Ωk, the total neutrino mass ∑mν, the effective number of neutrinos Neff and the parameters associated with the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations. These H(z) data provide extra information on the accelerate rate of our universe at high redshifts. Therefore, adding these H(z) data significantly improves the constraints on cosmological parameters, such as the number of relativistic species. Moreover, we find that direct prior on H0 from HST can also give good constraints on some parameters, due to the degeneracies between these parameters and H0.},

The resulting virial mass and temperature increase from the lowest values of $1.6 \times 10^{15}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ and 9.8 keV in OCDM, the mid-range values of $9.0 \times 10^{15}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ and 31 keV in LCDM, to the highest values of $20.9 \times 10^{15}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, 65 keV in SCDM. As compared with the largest virialized object seen in the universe, the richest clusters of galaxies, we can safely rule out the OCDM model. In addition, the SCDM model is very unlikely because of the unreasonably high virial mass and temperature. Our computation favors the prevailing LCDM model in which superclusters may be marginally regarded as dynamically-virialized systems.},
